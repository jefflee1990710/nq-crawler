The market had expected a cut between 1mln and 1.4mln, and as such, this is in the middle of consensus views, but short of the 1.3mln BPD cut that was recommended by OPEC&#39;s economic committee last week. The new oil cut deal will last for a period of six months, starting in January, and will be reviewed in April 2019. Later, the Russian energy minister said that the deal could be amended based on market conditions. Delegates were reticent to provide a detailed breakdown of the magnitude of cuts per country, though Russia has indicated it will cut 228k BPD (Saudis were said to be pushing for 300k on Thursday). Although it wasn&#39;t in the official statement, three countries have been granted exemptions (Venezuela, Iran, Libya). * WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 1.12 HIGHER AT USD 52.61/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 1.61 HIGHER AT USD 61.67/BBL. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>White House Advisor Kudlow was upbeat on trade talks between the US and China and claimed that US President Trump might be willing to extend the 90-day period of negotiations; he also noted that car tariffs in China will come down rapidly while he is unsure whether the Huawei&rsquo;s CEO arrest will spill into to trade talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Brainard (Voter, Dovish) sees gradual rate hikes &quot;appropriate in the near term&quot; though she believes the this will increasingly depend on evolving US outlook. On the economy, she anticipates solid US growth next year and trend inflation to remain around target. She warned that some tail winds are fading and mentioned downside risks include softening overseas economies, Brexit risks, trade uncertainty, recent tightening of US financial conditions, fading fiscal stimulus likely in 2020. Fed&#39;s Bullard (Non-Voter, Dove) reiterated his call for the Fed to keep rates steady citing subdued inflation expectations in financial markets; he believes rates are at a good place and the US policy is at a crossroads. He added that revisions to common monetary policy rules show that the current rate is at or above neutral, and he is calling for a flat rate path over the next couple of years. He stated there is no point in the Fed inverting the yield curve to prevent inflation and warned the Fed could consider delaying a December rate increase because of a narrowed yield curve, then move in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NON-FARM PAYROLLS: </strong>155k jobs were added to the economy in November, falling sharply from the 250k addition seen in October and posting significantly below the 198k consensus. Looking at the breakdown, manufacturing employment rose by 27k while growth in services employment was slower than anticipated. ING Economics highlights that one of the major reasons explaining the slowdown in jobs&rsquo; growth is a shortage of workers since &ldquo;the proportion of firms that can&rsquo;t fill the vacancies remains at an all-time high&rdquo;; ING also notes that the employment growth rate in 2018 has been accelerating and currently stands at 206k/month (Prev. 187k in 2017), but &ldquo;it will slow down&rdquo; in 2019&rdquo;.&nbsp; Average hourly earnings rose by 3.1% as expected and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%. Looking ahead, GS warns &ldquo;downward risk&rdquo; for Fed&rsquo;s tightening in 2019 given &ldquo;the combination of somewhat slower payroll growth and tighter financial conditions&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN</strong> was unchanged at 97.5, a tad above the 97.0 consensus. Analysts at Pantheon note that the index has been holding gains relatively well despite recent stock market volatility adding that recent decline in gas prices may have contributed to the solid figure. Overall, the sentiment remains elevated although &ldquo;the plunge in gas prices points to a bit of downward pressure over the next couple of months&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>Italy&#39;s Finance Minister Tria denied rumours he was going to resign while the 5-Star and PM Conte were said to favour his resignation and League&rsquo;s Salvini appeared to be opposing it. The Italian government now hopes to send a revised budget to the European Commission on Wednesday 13th December, the same evening of the EU Summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;SPX -2.33% at 2633, NDX -3.30% at 6613, DJI -2.24% at 24388. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -0.64%, Materials -2.52%, Industrials -2.62%, Cons Discretionary -3.08%, Cons Staples -1.29%, Healthcare -2.52%, Financials -1.84%, Tech -3.53%, Telecoms -2.09%, Utilities +0.40%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>FAANG stocks (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL) opened lower as risk appetite diminished on growing scepticism of a China-US trade truce; trade sensitive semiconductors (MU, INTC, AMD, NVIDIA) and industrials (DE, BA, CAT) naturally underperformed too. An OPEC agreement lead to a rise in crude prices helping the energy complex rise (XOM, CVX, EOG, COP, OXY, SLB). Altria Group (MO) opened higher after it took a USD 1.8bln stake in Canadian marijuana stock Cronos Group (CRON).Tesla (TSLA) outperformed following an upgrade at Jefferies. Broadcom (AVGO) reported strong earnings and guidance pushing it higher on the open. Airline stocks (JBLU, SAVE, AAL, LUV, UAL) underperformed as oil prices rose as well as Wolfe Research downgrading the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE &nbsp;1 TICK HIGHER AT 120-24+. </strong>Treasuries finished Friday&rsquo;s session in positive territory moving in tandem with equities and after non-farm payrolls indicated fewer jobs were created in November contributing to the view that growth is moderating. The yield curve saw some modest bull-flattening with short date yields lower by c.4bps and longer date yields lower by c.2bps. Spreads were mostly steeper and 2s3s were mostly unchanged after hitting their lowest level in more than 10 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY FX WRAP: * DXY: </strong>The broad Dollar and index are on course to end a bumpy and holiday shortened week on the backfoot as a significantly softer than expected payrolls number adds to recent data suggesting a downturn in economic momentum that could result in the Fed taking a time out after a 4th/final hike later this month. This, after reports about a potential switch into wait-and-see mode in 2019, and more importantly latest cautious FOMC comments from Chair Powell, VC Clarida and others. The DXY is now around 96.700 and closer to wtd lows than highs within a 97.210-96.370 range, eyeing Fib support at 96.612 on a closing basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The single currency is back up near the upper end of its 1.1413-1.1310 trading parameters amidst more positive developments on the Italian-EU budget front, as Rome seems destined to deliver a deficit target closer to the &lsquo;maximum&rsquo; 2% required to avoid excessive deficit measures. However, the generally softer Greenback also gave the Eur an indirect lift alongside speculation that the ECB could tweak policy guidance next week and divulge some details about its normalisation strategy after confirming that QE will end at the end of December. On the flipside, a hefty 2+ bn option expiry at the 1.1400 strike stalled gains beyond the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Bouts of short covering off a fresh 2018 low prompted a circa 100 pip rebound in Cable from 1.2658, but the Pound remains some distance away from 1.2840 highs and weak vs the Eur as the cross holds above 0.8900. Mixed UK PMIs did not really impact, even though the key services headline slipped perilously close to the 50.0 threshold, but Brexit developments kept Sterling depressed as PM May lost the first few rounds of official debating and no less than 3 votes ahead of next Tuesday&rsquo;s meaningful one in Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>A real roller-coaster and at times white knuckle ride for the Loonie, but Usd/Cad has somehow returned to roughly where it started, just over 1.3250. Friday&rsquo;s volatile moves between 1.3400-1.3255 were prompted by starkly contrasting Canadian vs US jobs reports, at least in headline terms as the former added a stellar 95k+ to its tally vs a mere 11k consensus. However, the Cad arguably derived even more or equal traction from another rebound in crude prices after Alberta&rsquo;s production cut and OPEC+ finally settled on a 1.2 mn output reduction after 3 very divisive days of discussions, which is at the top side of expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Marked divergence down under, as the Aud was undermined by external and internal impulses. US-China trade is still an issue even though both sides have pledged to act upon well meaning words and agreements in principle made between Presidents Trump and Xi at the G20, but the real damage was done by considerably weaker than forecast Q3 Aussie GDP and dovish-leaning commentary from RBA&rsquo;s Dabelle who maintained that the next move will be a rate hike, but also inserted an ease into the equation, if needed. Aud/Usd is languishing towards the base of 0.7190-0.7395 trading parameters, with Aud/Nzd only just on the 1.0500 handle vs around 1.0475 at one stage and a high of 1.0670, while the Kiwi is benefiting from the demise of its antipodean peer and keeping tabs on 0.6900 compared to almost 0.6850 at worst. Note also, the Aud failed to glean much from overall Usd downturn given huge option expiry interest at the 0.7250 strike (6.6 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>The classic if not always conforming safe-have currencies are narrowly mixed vs the Usd and holding within relative narrow ranges, with the Jpy seemingly hemmed in by mega options (112.50 and 113.00 in approx. 1.16 bn each), while the Franc is holding just shy of 0.9900 vs parity at the low ahead of next week&rsquo;s SNB quarterly policy review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SCANDI, EM: </strong>The Nok and most EM currencies are clawing back losses vs the Dollar, or stabilising at least, and encouraged by the post-OPEC+ announcement bounce in oil along with a wider revival in risk sentiment. However, the Sek sharply lagged behind having rallied markedly earlier in the week ahead of Swedish CPI data next week that could be crucial in terms of whether the Riksbank pulls the hike trigger this month or holds off until February 2019, and with seasonal factors also weighing before PPM flows also due next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>&nbsp;<strong>Sunday:</strong> Chinese CPI, Japanese GDP.&nbsp;<strong>Monday: </strong>UK GDP, Eurozone Sentiment Index <strong>Tuesday: </strong>EU General Affairs Council, UK Meaningful Vote, US PPI, UK Labour Report, German ZEW Survey <strong>Wednesday: </strong>Eurozone Industrial Production, US CPI <strong>Thursday:</strong> ECB, SNB, Norges Interest Rate Decisions, EU Summit, Australian &amp; New Zealand Mfg PMIs, Japanese Tankan Index <strong>Friday:</strong> EU Summit, Japanese Nikkei Mfg PMI, Chinese Retail Sales, Eurozone Flash PMIs, US Retail Sales &amp; Markit PMIs. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20730/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK WEEKLY:</strong> ECB to conclude asset purchases; what&rsquo;s next?

The market had expected a cut between 1mln and 1.4mln, and as such, this is in the middle of consensus views, but short of the 1.3mln BPD cut that was recommended by OPEC&#39;s economic committee last week. The new oil cut deal will last for a period of six months, starting in January, and will be reviewed in April 2019. Later, the Russian energy minister said that the deal could be amended based on market conditions. Delegates were reticent to provide a detailed breakdown of the magnitude of cuts per country, though Russia has indicated it will cut 228k BPD (Saudis were said to be pushing for 300k on Thursday). Although it wasn&#39;t in the official statement, three countries have been granted exemptions (Venezuela, Iran, Libya).</p>\r\n",

The market had expected a cut between 1mln and 1.4mln, and as such, this is in the middle of consensus views, but short of the 1.3mln BPD cut that was recommended by OPEC&#39;s economic committee last week. The new oil cut deal will last for a period of six months, starting in January, and will be reviewed in April 2019. Later, the Russian energy minister said that the deal could be amended based on market conditions. Delegates were reticent to provide a detailed breakdown of the magnitude of cuts per country, though Russia has indicated it will cut 228k BPD (Saudis were said to be pushing for 300k on Thursday). Although it wasn&#39;t in the official statement, three countries have been granted exemptions (Venezuela, Iran, Libya).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar and index are on course to end a bumpy and holiday shortened week on the backfoot as a significantly softer than expected payrolls number adds to recent data suggesting a downturn in economic momentum that could result in the Fed taking a time out after a 4th/final hike later this month. This, after reports about a potential switch into wait-and-see mode in 2019, and more importantly latest cautious FOMC comments from Chair Powell, VC Clarida and others. The DXY is now around 96.700 and closer to wtd lows than highs within a 97.210-96.370 range, eyeing Fib support at 96.612 on a closing basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is back up near the upper end of its 1.1413-1.1310 trading parameters amidst more positive developments on the Italian-EU budget front, as Rome seems destined to deliver a deficit target closer to the &lsquo;maximum&rsquo; 2% required to avoid excessive deficit measures. However, the generally softer Greenback also gave the Eur an indirect lift alongside speculation that the ECB could tweak policy guidance next week and divulge some details about its normalisation strategy after confirming that QE will end at the end of December. On the flipside, a hefty 2+ bn option expiry at the 1.1400 strike stalled gains beyond the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bouts of short covering off a fresh 2018 low prompted a circa 100 pip rebound in Cable from 1.2658, but the Pound remains some distance away from 1.2840 highs and weak vs the Eur as the cross holds above 0.8900. Mixed UK PMIs did not really impact, even though the key services headline slipped perilously close to the 50.0 threshold, but Brexit developments kept Sterling depressed as PM May lost the first few rounds of official debating and no less than 3 votes ahead of next Tuesday&rsquo;s meaningful one in Parliament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A real roller-coaster and at times white knuckle ride for the Loonie, but Usd/Cad has somehow returned to roughly where it started, just over 1.3250. Friday&rsquo;s volatile moves between 1.3400-1.3255 were prompted by starkly contrasting Canadian vs US jobs reports, at least in headline terms as the former added a stellar 95k+ to its tally vs a mere 11k consensus. However, the Cad arguably derived even more or equal traction from another rebound in crude prices after Alberta&rsquo;s production cut and OPEC+ finally settled on a 1.2 mn output reduction after 3 very divisive days of discussions, which is at the top side of expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marked divergence down under, as the Aud was undermined by external and internal impulses. US-China trade is still an issue even though both sides have pledged to act upon well meaning words and agreements in principle made between Presidents Trump and Xi at the G20, but the real damage was done by considerably weaker than forecast Q3 Aussie GDP and dovish-leaning commentary from RBA&rsquo;s Dabelle who maintained that the next move will be a rate hike, but also inserted an ease into the equation, if needed. Aud/Usd is languishing towards the base of 0.7190-0.7395 trading parameters, with Aud/Nzd only just on the 1.0500 handle vs around 1.0475 at one stage and a high of 1.0670, while the Kiwi is benefiting from the demise of its antipodean peer and keeping tabs on 0.6900 compared to almost 0.6850 at worst. Note also, the Aud failed to glean much from overall Usd downturn given huge option expiry interest at the 0.7250 strike (6.6 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classic if not always conforming safe-have currencies are narrowly mixed vs the Usd and holding within relative narrow ranges, with the Jpy seemingly hemmed in by mega options (112.50 and 113.00 in approx. 1.16 bn each), while the Franc is holding just shy of 0.9900 vs parity at the low ahead of next week&rsquo;s SNB quarterly policy review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDI/EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nok and most EM currencies are clawing back losses vs the Dollar, or stabilising at least, and encouraged by the post-OPEC+ announcement bounce in oil along with a wider revival in risk sentiment. However, the Sek sharply lagged behind having rallied markedly earlier in the week ahead of Swedish CPI data next week that could be crucial in terms of whether the Riksbank pulls the hike trigger this month or holds off until February 2019, and with seasonal factors also weighing before PPM flows also due next week.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.8%) were both higher at the open but gradually pared some of the gains as the risk tone began to turn cautious heading into today&rsquo;s key-risk NFP jobs data. Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp (U/C) were indecisive amid further PBoC inaction in which it remained net neutral for a 5th consecutive week and with the upcoming Chinese trade data over the weekend adding to tentativeness, while pharmaceuticals were the worst hit due to concerns of price declines from the government&rsquo;s centralized procurement program. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid a similar picture in T-note futures and although early selling pressure was seen in Japanese bonds alongside the strong open in stocks, prices later recovered as the risk appetite somewhat dissipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral for a 5th consecutive week.

(CNN/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to be weighing plan to postpone next week&#39;s Brexit vote, with her allies urging her to delay the vote amid forecasts for a catastrophic defeat. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Tory back benches leader Brady told PM May to go back to Brussels for further talks rather than suffer a heavy defeat in Parliament next week. (Times) Elsewhere, there were reports UK cabinet ministers advised PM May to come up with an 11th hour plan to get the deal through Parliament as the chief whip admitted she will lose the vote. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Labour Party leader Corbyn said his party could get a better deal and asked to be given a chance, while he added all options are on the table including election or 2nd referendum if PM May&#39;s botched deals fails. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aide to political strategist Lynton Crosby was said to be making behind-the-scenes preparations with prominent Leave campaigners for a 2nd referendum amid increasing view that Brexit stalemate in parliament could force a 2nd public vote. However, reports also noted that Lynton Crosby denied anyone from his company was working on 2nd referendum.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM Spokesperson says the vote is going ahead on Tuesday, adding that she believes it is the right deal for the country and PM May has no intention of extending Article 50. In addition, the UK government will consider an amendment on the backstop. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Economy Minister Tria spokesperson categorically rejects early reports regarding Tria&#39;s potential resignation. It was earlier suggested that Italy&#39;s Deputy PM Di Maio does not seek Economy Minister Tria&#39;s resignation; which followed reports that Deputy PM Salvini is also backing Tria, whilst the 5-Star Party and PM Conte are said to want Tria to resign.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) said the US economy is pretty strong and suggested the need to be nimble in responding to unexpected economic conditions. Williams also commented that higher US tariffs is uncertainty for businesses and that he is hearing some business are stepping back from investments which is likely to reduce the pace of the economy a little. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump&#39;s lawyers are said to have resumed discussions with Special Counsel Mueller&#39;s office.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities extended on gains from the cash open (Eurostoxx 50 +1.2%) following the cautious trade in the Asia-Pac session and the rebound seen on Wall St where the Dow clawed back nearly 700 points from intraday lows. European sectors are experiencing broad-based gains with marginal outperformance in the tech sector as IT names bounce back from yesterday&rsquo;s Huawei-driven slump. Meanwhile, energy names are volatile (currently marginally underperforming) as the complex awaits further hints from the key OPEC+ meeting today. In terms of individual movers, Fresenius SE (-15.0%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the company cut medium-term guidance, citing lower profit expectations at its clinics unit Helios and medical arm Fresenius Medical Care (-7.8%). On the flip side, Bpost (+7.5%) and Tesco (+4.8%) are hovering near the top of the pan-Europe index amid broker upgrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Typically rangebound trade in the run up to US labour data, and with markets also monitoring OPEC+ headlines as a decision on whether to cut output and if so by how much remains highly uncertain. The index is hovering just under the 97.000 handle within a 96.767-96.931 band, and well within nearest technical support and resistance levels at 96.300 and 97.311 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A marginal G10 underperformer as Cable retreats back below 1.2750 from just above 1.2800 at one stage, but this could be more flow-related rather than anything fundamental as Eur/Gbp rallied towards 0.8930 peaks from just under the big figure into the Frankfurt fixing before drifting back again. However, Halifax house prices were much weaker than expected and latest Brexit news is hardly Sterling supportive given more speculation about delaying the meaningful vote to try and avoid a resounding rejection, even though the Government appears to be resolute and standing firm on December 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is at the opposite end of a relatively narrow Usd/Major spectrum, and like the Pound also impacted by indirect factors to a degree, if not in the main. Indeed, Nzd/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.6900, but Aud/Nzd is pivoting 1.0500 as the Aussie unit continues to feel the adverse effects of recent bearish impulses, namely softer than forecast Q3 GDP and a more dovish RBA via Debelle. Hence, Aud/Usd is softer between 0.7210-40 parameters and bound to be wary of huge option expiries from 0.7250-60 in 6.6 bn that form a formidable barrier ahead of circa 1.2 bn up at 0.7300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY - In the pre-NFP &lsquo;hiatus&rsquo; and awaiting anything further on the Italian budget front, option expiries may also exert directional impetus on Eur/Usd and Usd/Jpy, as the former faces 2+ bn at the 1.1400 strike and latter is flanked by 1+ bn at 112.50 and 113.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie has pared a bit more lost ground from recent lows, albeit partly due to a broad Usd retracement, eyeing OPEC and also Canada&rsquo;s jobs report given latest BoC guidance indicating even greater data dependency. Usd/Cad currently just shy of the 1.3400 mark vs 1.3440+ at one stage yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts trade just below 123.40 (vs. a marginal new low of 123.33) and derived little inspiration from the BoE&rsquo;s TNS Inflation Attitudes Survey as core EU bonds continue to tread cautiously amidst an improved risk tone due to the stock turnaround and conjecture circulating overnight that the pace of Fed tightening in the near term may be slower than previously perceived or flagged, ahead of NFP today. Bunds are also conforming to the downturn as the German 10 year recently printed fresh session lows of 163.12 and remain pressured under 163.20, in contrast to the revival in its Italian peer (+39 ticks at 123.25). This comes after positive Roman rumblings categorically denying plots to topple Tria, or intentions that the Economy Minister has of resigning himself, alongside Deputy PM Di Maio claiming that the country will not face EDP measures. Strong retail sales may have added some momentum and helped lift the benchmark ahead of the expected budget revision provision next Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US 10-year futures are fractionally softer on balance from yesterday&rsquo;s close of 120-13 as trade remains nervy ahead of an action-packed session including Fed speak, the continuation of OPEC&rsquo;s meeting and the aforementioned monthly labour report. In the near term, Treasuries and markets in general are looking to see whether oil prices stabilise post-OPEC, alongside Fed policy implications after the latest update on jobs and wage growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+0.2%) and Brent (+0.9%) are choppy in what was a volatile session thus far as comments from energy ministers emerged ahead of the key OPEC+ meeting, after yesterday&rsquo;s OPEC talks ended with no deal for the first time in almost five years. Brent rose after source reports noted that Moscow are ready to cut output by 200k BPD (below OPEC&rsquo;s desire of 250k-300k but above Russia&rsquo;s prior &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; of 150k) if OPEC are willing to curb production by over 1mln BPD. Prices then fell to session lows following a less constructive tone from Saudi Energy Minister who reiterated that he is not confident there will be a deal today, which came after delegates noted that OPEC talks are focused on a combined OPEC+ cut of 1mln BPD (650k from OPEC and 350k from Non-OPEC). Markets are awaiting the start of the OPEC+ meeting after delegates stated that talks are at deadlocked as Iran appears to be the main sticking point to an OPEC deal, though sources emerged stating that Iran, Venezuela and Libya are set to get exemptions from cuts, adding that OPEC and Russia are looking for a symbolic production commitment from Iran as fears arise that Iran may not be able to follow-through on curb pledges due to US sanctions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of metals, gold hovers around session highs and is set for the best week since August with the USD trading in a tight range ahead of the key US jobs data later today, while London copper rose over a percent is underpinned by the positive risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a full rundown of OPEC commentary please see the relevant stories on our headline feed by using the &lsquo;Commodities&rsquo; filter.</p>\r\n",

European sectors are experiencing broad-based gains with marginal outperformance in the tech sector as IT names bounce back from yesterday&rsquo;s Huawei-driven slump. Meanwhile, energy names are volatile (currently marginally underperforming) as the complex awaits further hints from the key OPEC+ meeting today. In terms of individual movers, Fresenius SE (-15.0%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after the company cut medium-term guidance, citing lower profit expectations at its clinics unit Helios and medical arm Fresenius Medical Care (-7.8%). On the flip side, Bpost (+7.5%) and Tesco (+4.8%) are hovering near the top of the pan-Europe index amid broker upgrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Typically rangebound trade in the run up to US labour data, and with markets also monitoring OPEC+ headlines as a decision on whether to cut output and if so by how much remains highly uncertain. The index is hovering just under the 97.000 handle within a 96.767-96.931 band, and well within nearest technical support and resistance levels at 96.300 and 97.311 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - A marginal G10 underperformer as Cable retreats back below 1.2750 from just above 1.2800 at one stage, but this could be more flow-related rather than anything fundamental as Eur/Gbp rallied towards 0.8930 peaks from just under the big figure into the Frankfurt fixing before drifting back again. However, Halifax house prices were much weaker than expected and latest Brexit news is hardly Sterling supportive given more speculation about delaying the meaningful vote to try and avoid a resounding rejection, even though the Government appears to be resolute and standing firm on December 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is at the opposite end of a relatively narrow Usd/Major spectrum, and like the Pound also impacted by indirect factors to a degree, if not in the main. Indeed, Nzd/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.6900, but Aud/Nzd is pivoting 1.0500 as the Aussie unit continues to feel the adverse effects of recent bearish impulses, namely softer than forecast Q3 GDP and a more dovish RBA via Debelle. Hence, Aud/Usd is softer between 0.7210-40 parameters and bound to be wary of huge option expiries from 0.7250-60 in 6.6 bn that form a formidable barrier ahead of circa 1.2 bn up at 0.7300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY - In the pre-NFP &lsquo;hiatus&rsquo; and awaiting anything further on the Italian budget front, option expiries may also exert directional impetus on Eur/Usd and Usd/Jpy, as the former faces 2+ bn at the 1.1400 strike and latter is flanked by 1+ bn at 112.50 and 113.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie has pared a bit more lost ground from recent lows, albeit partly due to a broad Usd retracement, eyeing OPEC and also Canada&rsquo;s jobs report given latest BoC guidance indicating even greater data dependency. Usd/Cad currently just shy of the 1.3400 mark vs 1.3440+ at one stage yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts trade just below 123.40 (vs. a marginal new low of 123.33) and derived little inspiration from the BoE&rsquo;s TNS Inflation Attitudes Survey as core EU bonds continue to tread cautiously amidst an improved risk tone due to the stock turnaround and conjecture circulating overnight that the pace of Fed tightening in the near term may be slower than previously perceived or flagged, ahead of NFP today.

The index is hovering just under the 97.000 handle within a 96.767-96.931 band, and well within nearest technical support and resistance levels at 96.300 and 97.311 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A marginal G10 underperformer as Cable retreats back below 1.2750 from just above 1.2800 at one stage, but this could be more flow-related rather than anything fundamental as Eur/Gbp rallied towards 0.8930 peaks from just under the big figure into the Frankfurt fixing before drifting back again. However, Halifax house prices were much weaker than expected and latest Brexit news is hardly Sterling supportive given more speculation about delaying the meaningful vote to try and avoid a resounding rejection, even though the Government appears to be resolute and standing firm on December 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is at the opposite end of a relatively narrow Usd/Major spectrum, and like the Pound also impacted by indirect factors to a degree, if not in the main. Indeed, Nzd/Usd remains capped ahead of 0.6900, but Aud/Nzd is pivoting 1.0500 as the Aussie unit continues to feel the adverse effects of recent bearish impulses, namely softer than forecast Q3 GDP and a more dovish RBA via Debelle. Hence, Aud/Usd is softer between 0.7210-40 parameters and bound to be wary of huge option expiries from 0.7250-60 in 6.6 bn that form a formidable barrier ahead of circa 1.2 bn up at 0.7300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the pre-NFP &lsquo;hiatus&rsquo; and awaiting anything further on the Italian budget front, option expiries may also exert directional impetus on Eur/Usd and Usd/Jpy, as the former faces 2+ bn at the 1.1400 strike and latter is flanked by 1+ bn at 112.50 and 113.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has pared a bit more lost ground from recent lows, albeit partly due to a broad Usd retracement, eyeing OPEC and also Canada&rsquo;s jobs report given latest BoC guidance indicating even greater data dependency. Usd/Cad currently just shy of the 1.3400 mark vs 1.3440+ at one stage yesterday.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) were both higher at the open but gradually pared some of the gains as the risk tone began to turn cautious heading into today&rsquo;s key-risk NFP jobs data. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were indecisive amid further PBoC inaction in which it remained net neutral for a 5th consecutive week and with the upcoming Chinese trade data over the weekend adding to tentativeness, while pharmaceuticals were the worst hit due to concerns of price declines from the government&rsquo;s centralized procurement program. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid a similar picture in T-note futures and although early selling pressure was seen in Japanese bonds alongside the strong open in stocks, prices later recovered as the risk appetite somewhat dissipated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations and were net neutral for a 5th consecutive week. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8664 (Prev. 6.8599)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he agrees with the statement US and China are cooperating, while he also agrees that a deal is possible in the 90-day window. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US could use Huawei&#39;s CEO arrest as leverage to US-China talks according to reports which cited US administration officials, while it was also noted earlier that US investigation into China&#39;s Huawei includes accusations of bank fraud flagged up by HSBC and Iran sanction violations. (CNN/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is said to be weighing plan to postpone next week&#39;s Brexit vote, with her allies urging her to delay the vote amid forecasts for a catastrophic defeat. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Tory back benches leader Brady told PM May to go back to Brussels for further talks rather than suffer a heavy defeat in Parliament next week. (Times) Elsewhere, there were reports UK cabinet ministers advised PM May to come up with an 11th hour plan to get the deal through Parliament as the chief whip admitted she will lose the vote. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Labour Party leader Corbyn said his party could get a better deal and asked to be given a chance, while he added all options are on the table including election or 2nd referendum if PM May&#39;s botched deals fails. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An aide to political strategist Lynton Crosby was said to be making behind-the-scenes preparations with prominent Leave campaigners for a 2nd referendum amid increasing view that Brexit stalemate in parliament could force a 2nd public vote. However, reports also noted that Lynton Crosby denied anyone from his company was working on 2nd referendum. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s PM Conte said deficit was not discussed at ministers&#39; meeting, while he added that must find a solution with EU on 2019 budget and is working on details of a new meeting with EU&rsquo;s Juncker. (Newswires) Later it was reported that PM Conte and the 5 Star party are in favour of Finance Minister Tria resigning, while Italian Deputy PM Salvini opposes. (Stampa) However, further reports suggested that Tria has no intention of resigning. (La Repubblica)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remained softer and below the 97.00 level after the losses during the prior session in which ADP employment data missed expectations ahead of the Non-farm Payrolls and with reports suggesting that the Fed could adopt a wait and see approach next year, while Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan had also expressed concern regarding the knock-on effect of slower global growth. The weakness in the greenback had supported EUR/USD and GBP/USD although both pairs have since pulled back amid ongoing Italian budget and Brexit uncertainty, with price action then flatlining throughout Asia hours. Elsewhere, antipodeans were restricted amid lower oil prices due to the lack of solid breakthrough among OPEC members and following a weaker PBoC reference rate setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with oil prices subdued following the lack of solid breakthrough at yesterday&rsquo;s OPEC meeting and with Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih lacking confidence of reaching a deal today. However, not all were pessimistic with the Oman and UAE oil ministers hopeful of a deal, while reports also noted that a preliminary agreement was reached but with volumes not yet decided. Elsewhere, gold was relatively flat with only minimal support seen from the softer greenback as participants await the key US jobs data and copper was underpinned by the mostly positive risk tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih said OPEC was still deliberating with a 1mln cut as the scenario under discussion and that&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants Russia to cut as much as possible while Al Falih had also stated he is not confident of an agreement&nbsp;today. However, TASS later reported that OPEC reached a preliminary agreement and that volumes were not yet decided upon. (Newswires/TASS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia wants to cut oil production by a maximum of 150k BPD for the first three months of 2019, adding that the output could then be reviewed; according RIA citing sources. (RIA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran oil minister said it was a difficult OPEC meeting but also commented &quot;we are cooking something&quot; and suggested to wait until today, while Oman Oil Minister said he sees at least a 1mln BPD cut deal today which will include Russia and that cuts could be for either 3 months, 6 months or a year. Elsewhere, UAE Oil Minister said he was still optimistic that OPEC will reach a deal today and noted that the OPEC meeting was very good. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Treasuries caught a bid on Thursday amid deteriorating risk sentiment, market volatility and as data begun to signal some negativity in the US economy. The 10yr yield hit a 3-month low in the session while yields overall were higher by c.5bps at settlement; the move was led by the front end encouraged by a block trade as well as bull-flattens in Eur/Usd. Next week, the US Treasury will sell USD 38bln in 3-year notes, USD 24bln in 10-year notes, USD 16bln in 30-year bonds. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1.1+ ticks higher at 120-14+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell (Neutral) said the economy is currently performing very well overall and labor market is very strong by many measures, while he added that job creation is strong and wages are gradually increasing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Williams (Voter, Neutral) said the US economy is pretty strong and suggested the need to be nimble in responding to unexpected economic conditions. Williams also commented that higher US tariffs is uncertainty for businesses and that he is hearing some business are stepping back from investments which is likely to reduce the pace of the economy a little.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks saw cautious gains with the region getting an early tailwind after the sharp rebound on Wall St, where most majors finished lower albeit off worse levels as tech recovered and the DJIA clawed back nearly 700 points from intraday lows. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) were both higher at the open but gradually pared some of the gains as the risk tone began to turn cautious heading into today&rsquo;s key-risk NFP jobs data. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were indecisive amid further PBoC inaction in which it remained net neutral for a 5th consecutive week and with the upcoming Chinese trade data over the weekend adding to tentativeness, while pharmaceuticals were the worst hit due to concerns of price declines from the government&rsquo;s centralized procurement program. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat amid a similar picture in T-note futures and although early selling pressure was seen in Japanese bonds alongside the strong open in stocks, prices later recovered as the risk appetite somewhat dissipated.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade somewhat mixed despite the initial momentum from the sharp rebound on Wall St, where most majors finished lower albeit off worse levels amid a turnaround in tech and in which the DJIA clawed back nearly 700 points from intraday lows. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were both higher at the open but have gradually pared gains as the risk tone began to turn cautious heading into today&rsquo;s key-risk NFP jobs data. Hang Seng (+0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) are indecisive amid further PBoC inaction in which it remained net neutral for a 5th consecutive week and with the upcoming Chinese trade data over the weekend adding to tentativeness, while pharmaceuticals are the worst hit amid concerns of price declines from the government&rsquo;s centralized procurement program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains softer and below the 97.00 level after the losses during the prior session in which ADP employment data missed expectations ahead of the Non-farm Payrolls and with reports suggesting that the Fed could adopt a wait and see approach next year, while Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan had also expressed concern regarding the knock-on effect of slower global growth. The weakness in the greenback had supported EUR/USD and GBP/USD although both pairs have pulled back amid ongoing Italian budget and Brexit uncertainty, with trade currently flatlining in Asia hours. Elsewhere, antipodeans are subdued after oil prices were pressured by the lack of solid breakthrough among OPEC members and following a weaker PBoC reference rate setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat amid similar price action in T-note futures, although early selling pressure was seen in Japanese bonds alongside the strong open in stocks, before later recovering as risk momentum gradually dissipated. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
