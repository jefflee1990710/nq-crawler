Separately, traders reported that China purchased an unspecified amount of soybeans. Elsewhere, EU sources claimed that EU countries back anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations on electric bicycle imports from China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> A UK PM spokesperson reported that the Cabinet agreed that no-deal preparations need to be ramped up while the government is to recommend businesses and citizens to enact no-deal plans as they judge necessary. Brexit Secretary Barclay also ruled out revoking Article 50 to allow more time to prepare for a no deal Brexit, warning that the article cannot be revoked temporarily. Elsewhere, the DUP said PM May is apparently promising them the assurances they would require to back her deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&rsquo;s Makuch warned that if the economic slowdown continues the ECB may need to rephrase guidance while the timing of future interest rate growth is a matter of the state of the economy. He highlighted that risks include geopolitics, protectionism, vulnerability in EMs and market volatility as well as fiscal discipline is Italy and France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>A spokesperson to Italian Economy Minister Tria announced that Italy has completed a deal with the EU commission over the budget, adding that the agreement will be finalised on Wednesday while a source in the PM&#39;s office clarified that Italy has only received verbal assurances from the EU Commission over the budget deal. A government source also reported that the Commission has accepted the 2.04% deficit/GDP figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* HOUSING STARTS </strong>rose 2.3% in November to 1.256mln, significantly above the 1.225mln consensus. Looking at the breakdown, most of the rise was attributed to the volatile multi-family component which was up by ~22% while single-family fell for the third consecutive months; analysts at Wells Fargo highlight that some of this weakness could be explained by wildfires in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BUILDING PERMITS</strong> rose 5% in November posting at 1.328mln also above the 1.259mln consensus. As with housing starts, most of the gains were in the multifamily component while single-family nudged higher by just 0.1%. Looking ahead, Wells Fargo expects &ldquo;single-family to remain sluggish and look for multifamily starts to remain near their recent levels&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 3.64 LOWER AT USD 46.24/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 3.35 LOWER AT USD 56.26/bbl.</strong> Oil prices sold off sharply in earlier trade today, before catching a break as US equity markets opened in the green, but then suffered a fresh round of selling into the afternoon. The sell off today could well be attributed to the rollover of WTI contracts, where the January future expires tomorrow. The market is still sceptical of the OPEC+ cut agreement, with Russia&rsquo;s Novak today announcing a meeting with Russian oil producers tomorrow to discuss the cuts; Russia also announced a raise in December production compared to November ahead of the deal, acting as another downward catalyst. The market is now anticipating the latest API figures today where it&rsquo;s expecting a draw of 2.4mln in crude stocks, a build of 0.6mlnl in distillates, a build of 1.2mln in gasoline and a build of 630k in cushing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX +0.01% at 2546, NDX +0.67% at 6492, DJI +0.35% at 23676. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -2.35%, Materials +0.56%, Industrials +0.58%, Cons Discretionary +1.03%, Cons Staples -1.17%, Healthcare -0.80%, Financials -0.48%, Tech +0.86%, Telecoms +0.61%, Utilities -0.64%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> General Electric (GE) opened higher on the back of itself and TransnetBW announced a ramping up of transmission capacity in Southwest Germany. Strong earnings and guidance saw gains from Darden Restaurants (DRI) and Oracle (ORCL). Boeing (BA) outperformed on the open following an increase in its share repurchase programme as well as its quarterly dividend. Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) found its share price break off some of the relentless selling today, helped by a new share repurchase programme. Tech heavyweights Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) benefitted from positive risk appetite, pulling up indices. Phillip Morris (PM) opened lower after a downgrade at Credit Suisse. Stocks in the energy sector underperformed across the board as oil prices slumped today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 7+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-30+. </strong>Treasuries drifted higher on Tuesday on the back of a volatile session for the equity market and as investors remained cautious ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s FOMC meeting. The curve saw some modest bull-steepening as most of the action was concentrated in the front end of the curve where yields were lower by c.5bps at settlement; longer date yields were lower by c.4bps. Spreads widened by less than 1bps with the exception of 10s30s which were slightly narrower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY </strong>reclaimed the 97.000 level following strong US data in the form of housing starts and building permits; the index briefly touched 96.694 earlier in the session after Trump raised concern over the Fed&rsquo;s tightening policy. Focus now shifts to the FOMC rate decision due on Wednesday when the central bank is widely expected to hike rates by 25bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR/USD </strong>held above 1.1350 for most of the session though gains above 1.1400 were short-lived given a weak Ifo survey and despite Italy nearing a deal with the EU on the 2019 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP/USD </strong>consolidated below 1.2650 amid more Brexit uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD/USD </strong>was the outperformer amid an improvement in NZ own activity and business confidence overnight as well as another increase in GDT auction prices giving the pair impetus to reach highs of around 0.6879 vs. low of 0.6800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD/USD</strong> relatively flat and trading towards the lower end of a 0.7203-0.7166 following the RBA minutes in which the Board reiterated that that next move in rates is likely to be a hike but saw no strong case for a near-term change in policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD/CAD</strong> underpinned by another sharp sell-off in oil prices printing session&rsquo;s high at around 1.3494 and consolidating just below that level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD/JPY</strong> was unable to break key levels to the downside at 112.50 or recent lows at 112.20-25 with flight to safety supporting the Japanese currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW:</strong> BoJ policy announcement due Thursday 20th December 2018. The BoJ will conclude its last policy meeting of the year on Thursday and no major fireworks are anticipated given unanimous expectations for the Central Bank to maintain its policy settings of negative rates at -0.1% and the long-term yield target at around 0.0%. In addition, the BoJ is expected to keep its flexible approach on yields and reaffirm forward guidance maintaining current extremely low rates for an extended period. The Japanese Central Bank is also seen keeping its long-term JGB buying guidelines (holdings to increase at an annual pace of around JPY 80tln). Goldman Sachs expects the BoJ&rsquo;s ETF and other purchase programmes to remain unchanged as well. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20793/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>FOMC Rate Decision (December 2018) and forecasts to be announced 1900 GMT/1400 EST on 19 December 2018; Press conference with chair Powell scheduled for 1930 GMT/1430 EST). &nbsp;The Fed is expected to lift rates by 25bps to 2.25-2.50%, with risks the hiking trajectory could be narrowed. The tone of the statement and Chair Powell&rsquo;s press conference is expected to tilt dovish, reflecting a data-dependent FOMC on no pre-set course. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20798/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview. &nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n",

The sell off today could well be attributed to the rollover of WTI contracts, where the January future expires tomorrow. The market is still sceptical of the OPEC+ cut agreement, with Russia&rsquo;s Novak today announcing a meeting with Russian oil producers tomorrow to discuss the cuts; Russia also announced a raise in December production compared to November ahead of the deal, acting as another downward catalyst. The market is now anticipating the latest API figures today where it&rsquo;s expecting a draw of 2.4mln in crude stocks, a build of 0.6mlnl in distillates, a build of 1.2mln in gasoline and a build of 630k in cushing.</p>\r\n",

Similarly, the single currency and Pound briefly extended gains beyond 1.1400 and 1.2700 respectively before retreating relatively sharply amidst the ongoing Italian/French budget and Brexit uncertainty, while the Eur also had to contend with further evidence of the German economic downturn via the Ifo survey, although the sub-consensus readings did not impact initially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/NOK &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie and Norwegian Krona were both undermined by another sharp sell-off in oil with the &nbsp;former also slipping further through 1.3400 vs its US rival after considerably weaker than expected Canadian manufacturing sales and latter down to 9.9000+ against the Eur despite Norges Bank Governor Olsen underscoring March 2019 tightening intentions.</p>\r\n",

Underperformance is seen in the FTSE 100 (-0.5%) and the AEX (-0.8%) with both weighed on by index heavyweight Royal Dutch Shell (-1.8%) in the red as they are reportedly planning to purchase Endeavor Energy for USD 8bln. Sectors are similarly in the red with underperformance seen in energy names due to oversupply fears weighing on oil prices and the aforementioned Royal Dutch Shell story. Significant outperformance is seen in the European Auto&rsquo;s &amp; Parts sector, with auto names such as Daimler (+1.6%) and BMW (+1.0%) causing the DAX (+0.4%) to be the outperforming European index. Other notable equity movers include National Grid (-6.3%) who have stated that they are disappointed with OFGEM&rsquo;s proposed financial package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi is back in the ascendency and leading widespread advances against an increasingly soggy Dollar ahead of the FOMC amidst growing expectations for a dovish hike, with Nzd/Usd extending gains above 0.6800 and through 0.6850 to circa 0.6880 in wake of an encouraging NZ business survey overnight. This bodes well for the Westpac consumer report for Q4 due later ahead of current account data for the previous quarter and following the latest GDT auction that could see prices rebound further given WMP futures indicating a 3% rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The next best G10 performer and beneficiary of safe-haven positioning amidst broad risk-aversion in global equities and especially oil that continues to price in a return to oversupply vs demand. Consequently, Usd/Jpy has pulled back further from recent highs to retest December lows not far above 112.00, but may encounter some technical bids around 112.40 (100 DMA) given decent option expiries in the same area (1 bn from 112.40 to 112.55).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/AUD/EUR - All firmer vs the Greenback, as the DXY skirts nearest sub-97.000 chart support at 96.850, and the Buck&rsquo;s defensive pre-Fed tone overshadows independent factors that may otherwise keep the Pound, Aussie Dollar and single currency suppressed. For Sterling, Brexit remains the obvious and main stumbling block, but Cable is sitting more comfortably above 1.2600 and testing the 10 DMA at 1.2640, while Aud/Usd is staging another attempt to breach 0.7200 even though the Aud/Nzd cross has recoiled sharply to sub-1.0500 levels on the aforementioned Kiwi outperformance. Eur/Usd has also established a firmer base above a big figure, at 1.1300, and eyeing strong chart resistance at the foot of a daily formation just before a cluster of other upside targets around 1.1400 where a decent 1 bn expiry runs off. However, more downbeat German macro news in the form of December&rsquo;s Ifo survey has also dampened some of the Euro&rsquo;s more bullish momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF - The Loonie is struggling to bounce off 1.3400+ lows given the latest collapse in crude prices, which is also undermining the likes of the NOK despite March 2019 Norges Bank rate hike guidance from Governor Olsen, while the Franc continues to meet offers ahead of the 0.9900 mark and has eased back from peaks vs the Eur towards 1.1300 following more reports of convergence between Italy and the EU on the 2019 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial EU stock downturn and poor IFO data gave Bunds some additional steam to print fresh session highs at (163.55) but failed to test the contract peak of 163.64 with the benchmark now settling around the 163.50 level. Gilts have closed the gap on their German counterpart as upcoming commons Brexit debate continues to support 10-year futures, but pulled up short of chart resistance&nbsp;at 123.73 and hang around 123.65. Elsewhere, BTPs have gradually ticked up throughout the EU morning&nbsp; to trade in close proximity to session highs of 125.64 as the distance between the EU and Italy on the budget has narrowed to ~EUR 2bln vs. prev. EUR 4bln, with Tria supposedly hopeful of an agreement by tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to the US, 10-year futures printed a new recovery pinnacle at 120-27 ahead of the 120-30 highs of Dec. 10th with yields falling to as low as 2.823% at one point and hitting its lowest point since August ahead of the upcoming Fed meeting and today&rsquo;s housing data, where investors will look for confirmation of the poor NAHB survey results yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-2.3%) and WTI (-2.7%) have continued to decline amidst concerns of an oversupplied market, with WTI dropping to October 2017 levels. The price decline follows reports from the US, the world&rsquo;s largest oil producer, that their shale oil output is to top 8mln BPD by year end. There have also been comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak who states that December output is around Octobers levels which are slightly higher than in November; meaning that Russia&rsquo;s output has increased not decreased following the OPEC+ deal where they pledged a cut of 228,000 BPD. Later today we have API Weekly Stocks which are expected to present a 3.25MMbbls draw, which may offer prices some respite from the current downward pressure. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC has declared a force majeure on operations at the El Sharara oil field, stating that production will only restart after alternative security arrangements are implemented. For context, this follows the force majeure declared on the fields exports last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has benefited from dollar weakness reaching week highs of USD 1249.83/oz ahead of this week&rsquo;s FOMC meeting. While Palladium has fallen from the record high of USD 1269.5/oz reached in the previous session. Elsewhere Chinese steel and raw materials have fallen alongside the broader risk sentiment and after President Xi&rsquo;s speech where no new specific reform measures were stated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Minster Novak says he is to discuss the OPEC+ deal with Russian co.&rsquo;s on Wednesday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Sea Buzzard oil field output is now said to be at a normal level; according to sources. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

Sectors are similarly in the red with underperformance seen in energy names due to oversupply fears weighing on oil prices and the aforementioned Royal Dutch Shell story. Significant outperformance is seen in the European Auto&rsquo;s &amp; Parts sector, with auto names such as Daimler (+1.8%) and BMW (+1.0%) causing the DAX (+0.4%) to be the outperforming European index. Other notable equity movers include National Grid (-6.2%) who have stated that they are disappointed with OFGEM&rsquo;s proposed financial package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi is back in the ascendency and leading widespread advances against an increasingly soggy Dollar ahead of the FOMC amidst growing expectations for a dovish hike, with Nzd/Usd extending gains above 0.6800 and through 0.6850 to circa 0.6880 in wake of an encouraging NZ business survey overnight. This bodes well for the Westpac consumer report for Q4 due later ahead of current account data for the previous quarter and following the latest GDT auction that could see prices rebound further given WMP futures indicating a 3% rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - The next best G10 performer and beneficiary of safe-haven positioning amidst broad risk-aversion in global equities and especially oil that continues to price in a return to oversupply vs demand. Consequently, Usd/Jpy has pulled back further from recent highs to retest December lows not far above 112.00, but may encounter some technical bids around 112.40 (100 DMA) given decent option expiries in the same area (1 bn from 112.40 to 112.55).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/AUD/EUR - All firmer vs the Greenback, as the DXY skirts nearest sub-97.000 chart support at 96.850, and the Buck&rsquo;s defensive pre-Fed tone overshadows independent factors that may otherwise keep the Pound, Aussie Dollar and single currency suppressed. For Sterling, Brexit remains the obvious and main stumbling block, but Cable is sitting more comfortably above 1.2600 and testing the 10 DMA at 1.2640, while Aud/Usd is staging another attempt to breach 0.7200 even though the Aud/Nzd cross has recoiled sharply to sub-1.0500 levels on the aforementioned Kiwi outperformance. Eur/Usd has also established a firmer base above a big figure, at 1.1300, and eyeing strong chart resistance at the foot of a daily formation just before a cluster of other upside targets around 1.1400 where a decent 1 bn expiry runs off. However, more downbeat German macro news in the form of December&rsquo;s Ifo survey has also dampened some of the Euro&rsquo;s more bullish momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF - The Loonie is struggling to bounce off 1.3400+ lows given the latest collapse in crude prices, which is also undermining the likes of the NOK despite March 2019 Norges Bank rate hike guidance from Governor Olsen, while the Franc continues to meet offers ahead of the 0.9900 mark and has eased back from peaks vs the Eur towards 1.1300 following more reports of convergence between Italy and the EU on the 2019 budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial EU stock downturn and poor IFO data gave Bunds some additional steam to print fresh session highs at (163.55) but failed to test the contract peak of 163.64 with the benchmark now settling around the 163.50 level. Gilts have closed the gap on their German counterpart as upcoming commons Brexit debate continues to support 10-year futures, but pulled up short of chart resistance&nbsp; at 123.73 and hang around 123.65. Elsewhere, BTPs have gradually ticked up throughout the EU morning&nbsp; to trade in close proximity to session highs of 125.64 as the distance between the EU and Italy on the budget has narrowed to ~EUR 2bln vs. prev. EUR 4bln, with Tria supposedly hopeful of an agreement by tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving to the US, 10-year futures printed a new recovery pinnacle at 120-27 ahead of the 120-30 highs of Dec. 10th with yields falling to as low as 2.823% at one point and hitting its lowest point since August ahead of the upcoming Fed meeting and today&rsquo;s housing data, where investors will look for confirmation of the poor NAHB survey results yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-2.4%) and WTI (-2.5%) have continued to decline amidst concerns of an oversupplied market, with WTI dropping to October 2017 levels. The price decline follows reports from the US, the world&rsquo;s largest oil producer, that their shale oil output is to top 8mln BPD by year end. There have also been comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak who states that December output is around Octobers levels which are slightly higher than in November; meaning that Russia&rsquo;s output has increased not decreased following the OPEC+ deal where they pledged a cut of 228,000 BPD. Later today we have API Weekly Stocks which are expected to present a 3.25MMbbls draw, which may offer prices some respite from the current downward pressure. Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC has declared a force majeure on operations at the El Sharara oil field, stating that production will only restart after alternative security arrangements are implemented. For context, this follows the force majeure declared on the fields exports last week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has benefited from dollar weakness reaching week highs of USD 1249.83/oz ahead of this week&rsquo;s FOMC meeting. While Palladium has fallen from the record high of USD 1269.5/oz reached in the previous session. Elsewhere Chinese steel and raw materials have fallen alongside the broader risk sentiment and after President Xi&rsquo;s speech where no new specific reform measures were stated.</p>\r\n",

Looking ahead, another combustible Commons debate is scheduled after Labour&rsquo;s Corbyn called for a fresh vote of confidence in the PM, but with just 2 days to go before Parliament&rsquo;s recess for Xmas and the New Year the prospect of anything meaningful happening ahead of the rearranged vote on the withdrawal agreement some time in mid-January are slim. Hence, the focus may switch for a while at least to data in the form of inflation, retail sales, GDP and public finances from Wednesday through to Friday and either side of the BoE&rsquo;s last policy convene this year that looks set to be a dead rubber for all intents and purposes.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asian equities are mostly lower following the slump seen on Wall St. where the S&amp;P printed fresh lows for the year, while the Dow fell in excess of 500 points as shares in Amazon and Goldman Sachs led the decline. ASX 200 (-0.8%) is pressured by energy names amid the price action in the complex, while Nikkei 225 (-1.1%) underperforms due to a firmer currency amid safe-haven demand. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.1%) is just about kept afloat by the financial sector with the bourse&rsquo;s big four banks firmly in the green. Meanwhile, Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) is also weighed on by the latest decline in oil alongside weakness in industrials, real estate and consumer staples as the markets await Chinese President Xi Jinping&rsquo;s landmark speech at China&rsquo;s 40th anniversary of market reform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the Dollar index eased further to print fresh session lows just above the 97.000 line (97.040-150 range) ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s long-awaited FOMC rate decision as markets gear up for a dovish hike. As such EUR/USD is lifted above 1.1350 while and GBP/USD extends gains north of 1.2600. Elsewhere, NZD/USD is the marked outperformer amid an improvement in ANZ business confidence and own activity which gave the Kiwi impetus to reach highs of around 0.6850 (vs. low of 0.6800). Meanwhile, AUD hit resistance at the psychological 0.7200 level while moving higher with its antipodean counterpart after initially shrugging off the release of the RBA minutes in which the Board reiterated that that next move in rates is likely to be a hike but saw no strong case for a near-term change in policy. Finally, JPY is holding onto safe-haven spurred gains and remains sub-113.00 against the buck with the next level to the downside in USD/JPY at 112.40 (100DMA) ahead of the December low around 112.20.</p>\r\n",
