        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP – 21st November 2018: Stocks rebound heading into Thanksgiving",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, treasuries down, dollar down, crude up.<br />* REAR-VIEW: European Commission rejects Italy&rsquo;s budget, PM May and EU Juncker fail to finalise Brexit deal, US excludes Navarro from Trump-Xi summit, US durables drop, existing home sales rise, Uni of Michigan miss.<br />* AHEAD: ECB Minutes, SARB Rate Decision, BoE&rsquo;s Haldane and Saunders Speaking, ECB&rsquo;s Mersch to speak.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NOTE: Early Market Closures due to Thanksgiving: Thursday the desk will operate a normal service on Thursday until 1800GMT/1200CST, upon which the desk will close and then re-open later at 2200GMT/1600CST for the beginning on the Asia-Pacific session given the US market closures. Friday the desk will operate a normal service on Friday until 1845GMT/1245CST, upon which the desk will close given the US market closures.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>The European Commission rejected Italy&rsquo;s budget on Wednesday and warranted the possibility of an excessive debt procedure against the country. In comments, European Commissioner Moscovici warned that the &quot;very serious&quot; Italy deviation must be corrected while the Eurogroup President said to support a sanction procedure against the region with ministers set to discuss the sanction procedure in December. In response, PM Conte said that the government is convinced its 2019 budget is &quot;excellent&quot; and in the interests of Italy and Europe, while he said to be concerned overt the spread stating that he will respond with reforms. Deputy PM Salvini is looking to continue polite discussions with the EU but will proceed while he believes that EU sanctions can be avoided and similarly Economy Minister Tria said he is convinced the budget guarantees goal of reducing debt to GDP ratio and he remains committed to open dialogue with the EU Commission. UK PM May has met EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>A spokesperson announced that the PM May and EU&rsquo;s Juncker have failed to finalise an agreement on the terms of Brexit at their meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, although very good progress was made in talks. Brexit negotiators will work through the night to finalise the deal. As a brief summary to where we stand, effort made by Brexiteers to force a no-confidence vote over PM May seem to have failed for now, with focus now shifting on issues raised by France over fishing rights, Spain over Gibraltar co-sovereignty and all, including Germany, pushing for tougher conditions on the UK after Brexit. Note the Chief Minister of Gibraltar will brief Gibraltar&#39;s Parliament on Thursday at 2pm GMT on the status of Brexit negotiations ahead of the Special European Council on Sunday. In earlier comments, a PM May&#39;s spokesperson said that negotiations will take as long as needed to get the right deal for the UK and later denied reports suggesting that the EU Special Summit scheduled for Sunday could be called off. Elsewhere, Irish PM Varadkar said that the government has made no plans for a hard border adding that a no-deal scenario would require a deal on regulations and custom union with the UK.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Earlier this morning, the SCMPA announced that the US has reportedly excluded US Trade Advisor Navarro from the Trump-Xi summit while in there were separate reports in the FT suggesting that the G20&rsquo;s longstanding call to resist trade protectionism is in the balance ahead of the Argentina summit. Additionally, the WTO are to set up a dispute panel to rule on US complaint against China over IP rights; China contested &quot;false claims&quot; made by the US in the IP complaints at the meeting telling the WTO that those complaints lack credibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US Defence Secretary Mattis said he will reduce the scope of military exercise with South Korea to ensure the exercises will not be harmful to diplomatic efforts. Note the annual joint military drills between South Korea and US have caused friction with China and North Korea in the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US DURABLES </strong>fell by 4.4% in October significantly more than the expected 2.5% and the largest fall since October 2017. September gains were also swept away by revisions. Looking at the breakdown, volatility in the aircraft and defence sectors have contributed to the headline weakness. Non-defence capital goods orders posted flat, with the last monthly increase seen in July, with the &ldquo;three-month average annualized growth rate is now the lowest since March&rdquo; Wells Fargo notes. Looking ahead, Wells Fargo expects &ldquo;business equipment spending to bounce back in Q4 after a weak Q3 but for the pace to be below the robust rates seen in H1-2018&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EXISTING HOME SALES </strong>rose to 5.22mln from 5.15mln and slightly above the 5.20mln expectations. The uptick in sales is consistent with the message conveyed by pending home sales in September; hurricanes have depressed activity relative to mortgage applications&rsquo; trend. Analysts at Pantheon expect a rebound in the coming months, up to the end of the year, but do stress that the housing market is slowing down, amid higher interest rates and more severe lending standard, but &ldquo;broad declines are very unlikely&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.3% at 2650, NDX +0.8% at 6576, DJI -0.0% at 24464. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +1.6%, Materials +0.8%, Industrials +0.7%, Cons Discretionary +1.0%, Cons Staples -0.8%, Healthcare -0.5%, Financials +0.1%, Tech +0.6%, Telecoms +1.0%, Utilities -1.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Footlocker (FL) reported EPS, revenue and same store sales above estimates making it a top mover on the day; FL supplier Nike (NKE) caught a bid on this too. Autodesk (ADSK) and Keysight Technologies (KEYS) traded higher after beating EPS and revenue estimates whilst raising guidance. FAANG stocks rebounded higher today with Facebook (FB) leading the bunch. Utilities was an underperforming sector today with Duke Energy (DUK), American Electric Power (AEP) and WEC Energy (WEC) all trading lower. Pharmaceutical stocks Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) and Eli Lilly (LLY) were other bottom movers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES $1.20 HIGHER AT $54.63; BRENT (F9) SETTLES $0.95 HIGHER AT $63.48. </strong>After crude skidded lower on Tuesday, the complex has stabilised; API&#39;s weekly energy inventory data provided some support after Tuesday&#39;s settlement, where headline crude stocks drew unexpectedly. That, however, was not seen in the official DOE data (Crude +4.851mln vs exp 2.941mln; Cushing -0.116mln; Gasoline -1.295mln vs exp -0.198mln; distillates -0.077mln vs exp -2.754mln; production unchanged in the week). The data was bearish for crude but more positive for products; crude fell after the release, though did find a bid as the Thanksgiving holiday approached and traders left their desks. Traders were passing around a Goldman Sachs note (released late Tuesday), which argued that the crude sell-off has overshot fundamentals, but GS said prices will continue to be highly volatile until fundamentals improve (decline in OPEC production; signs demand growth is resilient; reversal in recent inventory builds).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 119-07+. </strong>Volumes and action were light on Wednesday ahead of Thursday Thanksgiving market holiday. After trading lower in Asia, T-Notes ticked up in European trade, but once again found some sellers around the US open, with dealer positioning ahead of the TIPS supply being cited. The bias was for yield curve narrowing, with 2s5s tightening to levels not seen in 11-years+. The Treasury sold USD 11bln of 10-year TIPS, tailing 0.2bps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback has retreated a bit further from recent peaks, with the DXY dipping below 96.500 at one stage and not helped or enthused by US data/survey misses in the form of weekly claims, durables and Michigan sentiment that together overshadowed firmer than forecast existing home sales and inline leading indicators in the run up to the long holiday weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>Consolidating recovery gains vs their US counterpart amidst a broad revival in risk sentiment, with the Kiwi now retesting 0.6850 and Aud extending its rebound to 0.7250+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CAD, GBP: </strong>Also benefiting from the Buck&rsquo;s defensive ahead of Thanksgiving, with the single currency managing to hold around 1.1400 into the NY cut when a decent 1 bn option expiry ran off amidst more Italian vs EU budget disharmony after Brussels officially ruled that the fiscal draft contravened the rules and warranted excessive deficit procedures. Meanwhile, the Loonie resisted significantly weaker than expected Canadian wholesale trade data with the aid of a rebound in crude and other commodity prices to keep its head above 1.3300. Sterling also showed a degree of resilience in the face of ongoing Brexit uncertainty and contradictory headlines on the proviso rather than firm or confident perception that UK PM May returns from Brussels with anything new on the withdrawal proposal front that will sway Parliament doubters to back the proposed divorce settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, JPY: </strong>A degree of divergence between the two renowned safe havens as the Franc retained an element of allure/demand in wake of the aforementioned impasse on Italy&rsquo;s expansionary plans, while the Jpy suffered more than the Usd as risk appetite resurfaced and struggled to rebound from circa 113.00 levels despite the potential draw of huge option expiries below the big figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Widespread gains vs the retreating Usd, but the Zar and Try outperformed on multiple factors including a marginal consensus for an SARB hike tomorrow and bullish technical as the Lira retested recent highs circa 5.310.</p>\r\n",

The data was bearish for crude but more positive for products; crude fell after the release, though did find a bid as the Thanksgiving holiday approached and traders left their desks. Traders were passing around a Goldman Sachs note (released late Tuesday), which argued that the crude sell-off has overshot fundamentals, but GS said prices will continue to be highly volatile until fundamentals improve (decline in OPEC production; signs demand growth is resilient; reversal in recent inventory builds).</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) were led lower by spill-over selling seen across the commodity-related sectors, while Wesfarmers shares plummeted nearly 30% after the spin-off of its Coles unit which had its stock market debut today. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) opened with firm losses but then rebounded off their lows with price action choppy amid ongoing trade uncertainty and after criticism from USTR Lighthizer&rsquo;s report that China has not altered its unfair practices and appears to have conducted further unreasonable actions in recent months. Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the widespread risk averse tone with price action subdued amid a lack of BoJ presence in the bond market and after the weakness in T-notes as US investors closed positions heading in to Thanksgiving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese President Xi is expected to visit Madrid next week where infrastructure investment is expected to be a topic for discussions.

(BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel says we still don&#39;t know how to solve the Spanish objections to the Brexit deal; although she believes a solution will be found by Sunday. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BBC&#39;s Katya Adler tweets, Behind the scenes, Germany remains irritated with EU countries like France pushing for tougher conditions on the U.K. in the Brexit deal.

Additionally, Salvini says that debt will fall if the economy grows and that the coalition is here to stay. Also, states that the government are convinced by their budget target and will talk about it in a year, believes that EU sanctions can be avoided. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European Commission rejects Italy&#39;s budget, as according to Ansa, who add that the European Commission say opening of EDP vs. Italy is warranted. (Newswires) EU Commissions Dombrovsksis adds that the EDP is warranted, with the EU Commission seeing risk of a negative impact on growth from the Italian budget. Also, Belgium. France and Spain are at risk of breaching the budget rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian 5SM lawmaker D&#39;Uva states that the party will not go back on the budget.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.8%) as the region stemmed the stock rout seen in Asia and Wall Street. Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (+0.6%) was initially outperforming with Italian banks higher amid initial reports from Italian press that Deputy PM Salvini could potentially be open to budget revisions, which were later dismissed by League sources ahead of the budget ultimately being rejected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of sectors, financial names lost the top spot to telecom names, who are outperforming after French telecoms jumped following comments from Orange (+1.7%) CEO which renewed M&amp;A gossip. Elsewhere, Indivior (-13.6%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx600 (+0.4%) after the Co. lost a US court ruling that had prevented Dr. Reddy&rsquo;s from selling a generic version of a treatment for opioid addiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index has maintained its recovery momentum into the midweek session, but is off best levels amidst a welcome reprieve in riskier assets and broad sentiment ahead of Thanksgiving. The DXY has drifted back from another uptick towards 97.000, though remains underpinned ahead of 96.500 and recent lows. The Greenback also retains an underlying bid as G10 and EM counterparts struggle to recoup losses beyond round number/psychological/technical resistance against the backdrop of heavy option expiries at strikes within close proximity to prevailing prices (and with major fundamental issues still prescient of course).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Antipodean Dollars are back in the ascendency as risk aversion seen on Monday and Tuesday abates, and the Yuan rebounds off circa 6.9500 lows vs the Usd after a weaker PBoC midpoint setting overnight and temporary breach of the Cny&rsquo;s 20 DMA (6.9417). The Kiwi is back above 0.6800 after tripping some stops below late yesterday and the Aud has reclaimed 0.7200+ status as the cross holds continues its recovery/consolidation from sub-1.0600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD - The single currency is holding up relatively well given more toing and froing on the Italian budget, but ultimately ongoing recalcitrant stance from Rome after reports about potential revisions were renounced in advance of the EU&rsquo;s official rejection and potential if not probable EDP implementation (scheduled release time 11.00GMT, but appears to have been preannounced). However, 1.1400 is proving almost as obstinate and a decent 1 bn option expiry could well be keeping the headline pair in check. Meanwhile, the Loonie is off worst levels after sliding through 1.3300 and could be gleaning some encouragement from a partial recovery in oil prices in the run up to Canadian wholesale trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/JPY - All bucking the overall trend, albeit barely in terms of the Pound and Franc, as Cable pivots 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp straddles 0.8900 on Parliament approval aspirations as UK PM May heads to Brussels for more discussions on the Brexit draft and the coup to oust her seems to have fizzled out. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf has only tentatively bounced from near 0.9900 lows within a 0.9935-55 range vs Usd/Jpy back on the 113.00 handle vs a base around 112.30 at one stage on Tuesday when risk-off flows were rife, but bidding interest prevented further downside. Note, a raft of option expiries could be key into the NY cut, stretching from 111.90-112.00 to 114.00 and totalling some 11 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Rand in focus for several reasons, as Usd/Zar hovers near 14.0000 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s SARP policy meeting and following softer than expected SA inflation data, with a decent 1.1+ bn options expiring between 13.9000-14.0000 along with speculation about more strike action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+1.6%) and Brent (+1.4%) took a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s selloff, where prices fell almost 7% with the decline attributed to supply concerns, negative risk sentiment and Trump&rsquo;s protective approach to Saudi relations. Prices are underpinned by the latest API inventory data which printed a surprise drawdown in headline crude stockpiles. Traders will be keeping an eye on today&rsquo;s DoE release for any hints of increased US shale production. Today will also see the release of the EIA natural gas storage data, which has been rescheduled due to the US Thanksgiving Holiday. Elsewhere, the metals complex is in positive territory with gold (+0.2%), silver (+0.7%) and copper (+0.5%) all supported by the pullback in the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs said slump in oil reflects over supply concerns for 2019 and that technical position factors have exacerbated the volatility, while it also cited low liquidity heading into Thanksgiving as well as broader selling in commodities and cross-assets amid rising growth concerns. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twitter source noted that a monster storm had shut all of Eastern Canada&#39;s crude output but added that one field has now resumed service. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi oil production is said to surge to record levels in early November; Saudi crude output has run at 10.8-10.9mln BPD. With supply having passed 11mln B/D on some days, which includes draw downs from stocks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps perversely, or at least against counterintuitively, Italian bonds retain a decent bid in wake of confirmation that the 2019 fiscal draft falls foul of EU rules and will therefore be subject to official measures from Brussels. The 10 year benchmark has actually bounced off a 120.52 low to record a new intraday peak of 121.79 (+148 ticks), as the top brass in Rome remain adamant, albeit intending to discuss the situation further. Hence, safe-haven Bunds, Gilts, and US Treasuries by default are not deriving any real support from spread or hedge positioning and remain below parity, albeit off worst levels (160.48 for Bunds, -41 ticks) despite a well received Bobl auction. However, price action and direction is prone to change or more pronounced volatility with a front-loaded US agenda before Thanksgiving and no guarantee that Wall Street will pick-up the recovery baton.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20604/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.8%) as the region stemmed the stock rout seen in Asia and Wall Street. Italy&rsquo;s FTSE MIB (+0.6%) was initially outperforming with Italian banks higher amid initial reports from Italian press that Deputy PM Salvini could potentially be open to budget revisions, which were later dismissed by League sources ahead of the budget ultimately being rejected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of sectors, financial names lost the top spot to telecom names, who are outperforming after French telecoms jumped following comments from Orange (+1.7%) CEO which renewed M&amp;A gossip. Elsewhere, Indivior (-13.6%) fell to the foot of the Stoxx600 (+0.4%) after the Co. lost a US court ruling that had prevented Dr. Reddy&rsquo;s from selling a generic version of a treatment for opioid addiction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index has maintained its recovery momentum into the midweek session, but is off best levels amidst a welcome reprieve in riskier assets and broad sentiment ahead of Thanksgiving. The DXY has drifted back from another uptick towards 97.000, though remains firm/underpinned ahead of 96.500 and recent lows. The Greenback also retains an underlying bid as G10 and EM counterparts struggle to recoup losses beyond round number/psychological/technical resistance against the backdrop of heavy option expiries at strikes within close proximity to prevailing prices (and with major fundamental issues still prescient of course).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Antipodean Dollars are back in the ascendency as risk aversion seen on Monday and Tuesday abates, and the Yuan rebounds off circa 6.9500 lows vs the Usd after a weaker PBoC midpoint setting overnight and temporary breach of the Cny&rsquo;s 20 DMA (6.9417). The Kiwi is back above 0.6800 after tripping some stops below late yesterday and the Aud has reclaimed 0.7200+ status as the cross holds continues its recovery/consolidation from sub-1.0600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD - The single currency is holding up relatively well given more toing and froing on the Italian budget, but ultimately ongoing recalcitrant stance from Rome after reports about potential revisions were renounced in advance of the EU&rsquo;s official rejection and potential if not probable EDP implementation (scheduled release time 11.00GMT, but appears to have been preannounced). However, 1.1400 is proving almost as obstinate and a decent 1 bn option expiry could well be keeping the headline pair in check. Meanwhile, the Loonie is off worst levels after sliding through 1.3300 and could be gleaning some encouragement from a partial recovery in oil prices in the run up to Canadian wholesale trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/JPY - All bucking the overall trend, albeit barely in terms of the Pound and Franc, as Cable pivots 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp straddles 0.8900 on Parliament approval aspirations as UK PM May heads to Brussels for more discussions on the Brexit draft and the coup to oust her seems to have fizzled out. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf has only tentatively bounced from near 0.9900 lows within a 0.9935-55 range vs Usd/Jpy back on the 113.00 handle vs a base around 112.30 at one stage on Tuesday when risk-off flows were rife, but bidding interest prevented further downside. Note, a raft of option expiries could be key into the NY cut, stretching from 111.90-112.00 to 114.00 and totalling some 11 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Rand in focus for several reasons, as Usd/Zar hovers near 14.0000 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s SARP policy meeting and following softer than expected SA inflation data, with a decent 1.1+ bn options expiring between 13.9000-14.0000 along with speculation about more strike action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps perversely, or at least against counterintuitively, Italian bonds retain a decent bid in wake of confirmation that the 2019 fiscal draft falls foul of EU rules and will therefore be subject to official measures from Brussels. The 10 year benchmark has actually bounced off a 120.52 low towards 121.00 again, as the top brass in Rome remain adamant, albeit intending to discuss the situation further. Hence, safe-haven Bunds, Gilts, and US Treasuries by default are not deriving any real support from spread or hedge positioning and remain below parity, albeit off worst levels (160.48 for Bunds, -41 ticks) despite a well received Bobl auction. However, price action and direction is prone to change or more pronounced volatility with a front-loaded US agenda before Thanksgiving and no guarantee that Wall Street will pick-up the recovery baton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+1.6%) and Brent (+1.4%) took a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s selloff, where prices fell almost 7% with the decline attributed to supply concerns, negative risk sentiment and Trump&rsquo;s protective approach to Saudi relations. Prices are underpinned by the latest API inventory data which printed a surprise drawdown in headline crude stockpiles. Traders will be keeping an eye on today&rsquo;s DoE release for any hints of increased US shale production. Today will also see the release of the EIA natural gas storage data, which has been rescheduled due to the US Thanksgiving Holiday. Elsewhere, the metals complex is in positive territory with gold (+0.2%), silver (+0.7%) and copper (+0.5%) all supported by the pullback in the USD</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The index has maintained its recovery momentum into the midweek session, but is off best levels amidst a welcome reprieve in riskier assets and broad sentiment ahead of Thanksgiving. The DXY has drifted back from another uptick towards 97.000, though remains firm/underpinned ahead of 96.500 and recent lows. The Greenback also retains an underlying bid as G10 and EM counterparts struggle to recoup losses beyond round number/psychological/technical resistance against the backdrop of heavy option expiries at strikes within close proximity to prevailing prices (and with major fundamental issues still prescient of course).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Antipodean Dollars are back in the ascendency as risk aversion seen on Monday and Tuesday abates, and the Yuan rebounds off circa 6.9500 lows vs the Usd after a weaker PBoC midpoint setting overnight and temporary breach of the Cny&rsquo;s 20 DMA (6.9417). The Kiwi is back above 0.6800 after tripping some stops below late yesterday and the Aud has reclaimed 0.7200+ status as the cross holds continues its recovery/consolidation from sub-1.0600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is holding up relatively well given more toing and froing on the Italian budget, but ultimately ongoing recalcitrant stance from Rome after reports about potential revisions were renounced in advance of the EU&rsquo;s official rejection and potential if not probable EDP implementation (scheduled release time 11.00GMT, but appears to have been preannounced). However, 1.1400 is proving almost as obstinate and a decent 1 bn option expiry could well be keeping the headline pair in check. Meanwhile, the Loonie is off worst levels after sliding through 1.3300 and could be gleaning some encouragement from a partial recovery in oil prices in the run up to Canadian wholesale trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All bucking the overall trend, albeit barely in terms of the Pound and Franc, as Cable pivots 1.2800 and Eur/Gbp straddles 0.8900 on Parliament approval aspirations as UK PM May heads to Brussels for more discussions on the Brexit draft and the coup to oust her seems to have fizzled out. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf has only tentatively bounced from near 0.9900 lows within a 0.9935-55 range vs Usd/Jpy back on the 113.00 handle vs a base around 112.30 at one stage on Tuesday when risk-off flows were rife, but bidding interest prevented further downside. Note, a raft of option expiries could be key into the NY cut, stretching from 111.90-112.00 to 114.00 and totalling some 11 bn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rand in focus for several reasons, as Usd/Zar hovers near 14.0000 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s SARP policy meeting and following softer than expected SA inflation data, with a decent 1.1+ bn options expiring between 13.9000-14.0000 along with speculation about more strike action.</p>\r\n",

This is also in acknowledgement of an overall improvement in risk sentiment after Tuesday&rsquo;s rout, and ahead of the latest snapshot of UK Government finances that are forecast to reveal larger PSNB deficits for the month of October. Also on today&rsquo;s domestic docket, more commentary from BoE Governor Carney, but highly unlikely to offer anything new on the policy front in wake of yesterday&rsquo;s lengthy TSC testimony on the QIR that underlined a wait-and-see stance pending the precise details of Britain&rsquo;s departure from the EU and ensuing impact on the economy. Looking at price action since the Liffe opens, the 10 year debt future was marked down 15 ticks to 122.85 and briefly bounced to 122.90 before fading again, with the low so far at 122.72, effectively tracking moves in Bunds inversely with BTPs, as the former probed a bit deeper towards technical support at a marginal new Eurex base (160.54, -35 ticks) and latter inched a tad further above 121.00 to 121.33 (+102 ticks). Meanwhile, the 3 month strip is 2-3 ticks adrift.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Some stabilisation in broad risk sentiment and a partial recovery for some Asia-Pacific stock markets has sapped safe-haven demand for core debt, but the 10 year German benchmark is also conceding ground to recovering BTPs ahead of the EU&rsquo;s official judgement on Italy&rsquo;s 2019 budget due at 11.00GMT. The catalyst beyond basic short covering, comments attributed to Deputy PM Salvini suggesting some willingness to revise the fiscal draft, which seems to contradict the rigid stance from the coalition Government and could be perceived as a last ditch conciliatory offering. Nevertheless, BTPs have gapped higher and probed above 121.00 within a 120.79-121.28 range vs Tuesday&rsquo;s 120.31 close, while Bunds extended losses from an initial 160.71 print and brief uptick to 160.74 to 32 ticks at 160.57 before finding some underlying bids. On that note, market contacts are flagging the 160.54-49 area as nearest chart support, with a gap above the very early Eurex peak up to 160.84 if the tide turns again. However, rebounds may be capped or contained ahead of supply in the form of Eur3 bn Bobls.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks mostly weakened as the global stock rout continued into the region following the losses in US, where the DJIA dropped over 500 points to turn negative YTD and in which energy names were pressured as oil slumped nearly 7%. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) were led lower by spill-over selling seen across the commodity-related sectors, while Wesfarmers shares plummeted nearly 30% after the spin-off of its Coles unit which had its stock market debut today. Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) opened with firm losses but then rebounded off their lows with price action choppy amid ongoing trade uncertainty and after criticism from USTR Lighthizer&rsquo;s report that China has not altered its unfair practices and appears to have conducted further unreasonable actions in recent months. Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the widespread risk averse tone with price action subdued amid a lack of BoJ presence in the bond market and after the weakness in T-notes as US investors closed positions heading in to Thanksgiving.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) are led lower by spill-over selling seen across the commodity-related sectors, while Wesfarmers shares have also plummeted nearly 30% after the spin-off of its Coles unit which had its stock market debut today. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) opened with firm losses but have since rebounded off their lows to trade choppy amid ongoing trade uncertainty and criticism from USTR Lighthizer&rsquo;s report that China has not altered its unfair practices and appears to have conducted further unreasonable actions in recent months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have consolidated overnight as the major pairs take a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s heavy moves in which the greenback advanced on safe-haven flows and as its high-beta counterparts suffered amid the stock sell-off. As such, EUR/USD and GBP/USD languish below the 1.1400 and 1.2800 handles respectively, while commodity-linked currencies are also despondent following the extended declines in oil prices. Elsewhere, JPY-crosses attempt to nurse some of the losses from the risk-averse flows and USD/JPY remains firm with the pair propped up by the strength in the greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs failed to benefit from the widespread risk averse tone with price action subdued amid a lack of BoJ presence in the bond market and after the weakness in T-notes as US investors closed positions heading in to Thanksgiving.</p>\r\n",
