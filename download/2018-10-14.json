Intuit (INTU) was another gainer as was the technology sector as a whole. Johnson Controls International (JCI) was a bottom mover, mimicking poor performance from the wider utilities sector. Alongside PNC Financial (PNC), other regional banks Regions Financial (RF) and US Bancorp (USB) were down on the day. Estee Lauder (EL) also pushed lower after a downgrade at JPMorgan. SPX +1.4% at 2768, NDX +2.8% at 7160, DJI +1.2% at 25335.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries started the session negative amid a more constructive risk environment, where equities stabilised after the recent rout. The net result was that the T-Note traded within Thursday&rsquo;s range. There were upticks after a soft Uni of Michigan sentiment survey, and the complex firmed towards the close after equities suffered a little wobble. Some desks were noting that dealers sold into the upswing. Major spreads were uneventful. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1+ ticks lower at 118-11.</p>\r\n",
