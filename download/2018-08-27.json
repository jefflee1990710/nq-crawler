(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France President Macron said Paris wants a close relationship with London after Brexit but not if it means the EU&#39;s unravelling, while there were also reports that France PM Philippe stated they are still working towards a positive Brexit solution and has asked ministers to prepare a contingency plan in case of a no deal Brexit. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&rsquo;s Deputy PM Di Maio said if EU immigration policy does not change, Italy will use its veto on EU 7-yr budget plan. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IEA&#39;s Birol said he expects Venezuelan oil production to fall further, while he added that Libya and Nigeria are seeing some improvement in oil production but remain fragile countries. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Syrian Air Defences were reported to be on full alert due to concerns of a possible US strike. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yemen Houthis said&nbsp;they have launched drone strikes at Dubai International Airport according to Yemeni press, although the UAE denied these reports and stated there were no disruptions to operations. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US and Mexico have reached a trade deal to replace NAFTA and expects talks with Canada on trade to accelerate on Monday and wrap up by end of the week according to a senior US official. The reports added the US and Mexico deal would see 40%-45% of auto content made by workers earning an average of USD 16/hr and also includes an increase of regional content in autos to 75% from 62.5%. In addition, US Trade Representative Lighthizer said the deal is likely to be signed in November and sent to congress on Friday, while he also stated that NAFTA &#39;sunset clause&#39; shifted to a review process every 6 years that will not cause trade deal to expire. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he will terminate the existing NAFTA deal to go into this deal and that he will either put tariffs on Canada or reach a negotiated deal with them, while Trump also stated they could do a separate deal with Canada or make them part of the deal with Mexico. In related news, US President Trump had a call with Canadian PM Trudeau which the latter described as constructive and is said to be hopeful for a successful conclusion. (Newswires)<br /><br />White House Economic Adviser Kudlow said Mexico-US trade agreement is a significant victory for the economy and that they would like a good deal with Canada, while he also commented that they may resort to auto tariffs if Canada rejects deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico Foreign Minister Videgaray said it would be ideal if there was a trilateral NAFTA but added that Mexico can accept bilateral, while he added US and Mexico will go ahead if US and Canada cannot agree. In related news, Canadian official said flexibility is required in order to get a NAFTA deal this week and that several issues are still outstanding for Canada. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is working on a major infrastructure project and a massive roadway. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most sectors pushed higher on the back of U.S./Mexico trade talk progressions, primarily industrials where Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) made strong leads; automakers too, Ford (F) General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) being the biggest movers. The defensive utilities sector found itself dropping on the progressive sentiment. Chinese-based tech names (JD, BIDU, BABA, IQ) traded higher after the Chinese Central Bank intervened to stabilise the yuan. Advanced Micro Devices (ADM) led gains across the semis on the launch of its new Radeon Pro V340 graphics card to accelerate datacentre visualisation. Other names such as Micron (MU) and Intel (INTC) were supported by the news. Tesla (TSLA) was down on the day after CEO, Elon Musk over the weekend announced the automaker will remain public. Chipotle (CMG) suffered after being downgraded to underperform from neutral at Wedbush. CVS Health (CVS) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) enjoyed gains after the drug retailer announced the opening of a new distribution centre in Kansas City. SPX +0.8% at 2897, NDX +1.0% at 7559, DJI +1.0% at 26052.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were sold in the European morning in sympathy with bunds following a solid IFO report out of Germany. There was additional selling as the S&amp;P 500 hit fresh record highs, carrying on from last week. Additionally, selling action was spurred after the US and Mexico reached a bilateral trade deal. The US Treasury sold $36bln of 2-year notes with the high-yield coming in on the screws (2.655%). The participation metrics were in-line with recent auctions and saw average demand, with indirects taking the largest portion whilst dealers were awarded the biggest share since May and directs the smallest portion since February. US 10-year T-notes settled 5+ ticks lower at 120-11.</p>\r\n",

Under the agreement, there would not be a sunset clause, instead, there will be a review process every 6 years that will not cause trade deal to expire. He also noted NAFTA will have a 16 years life span to be extended for another 16 year after completion of each 6 years period. The deal will be signed in November, and sent to Congress to on Friday. While there were some details provided, analysts noted that many will not be revealed until much later, and the deal is by no means a &lsquo;final&rsquo; agreement given it will need Congressional approval. But Evercore ISI said the deal was a positive: &ldquo;Trump&#39;s statements about &ldquo;terminating&rdquo; the original NAFTA, renaming the agreement, and presenting Canada with a choice of auto tariffs or making significant concessions, including on dairy (both were mentioned by him today), all should be viewed as presidential rhetoric designed to increase pressure on Canada (and particularly Prime Minister Trudeau, with whom Trump has a contentious relationship) as the endgame negotiations begin. (It also is designed to pump up the renegotiated NAFTA as more than tweaks to the quarter-century old existing agreement.) Canada, Mexico, and, most importantly, the US Congress that has to ratify the new agreement to make it effective, all see the new agreement as a three-party deal, and all will see it as a continuation of the letter and spirit of the original agreement. These three countries have not come this far to back out of a final deal, and one should be forthcoming in the next weeks.&rdquo; Trump noted that the US has not started with Canada yet as they first wanted to see if deal with Mexico was possible, adding they will terminate NAFTA to go into this deal and they will be looking to place tariffs on Canada or reach a negotiated agreement with them. As a side note, Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland was said to be heading to Washington on Tuesday for trade talks. Separately, a Canadian official says flexibility is required in order to get a NAFTA deal this week, several issues are still outstanding for Canada. On China, Trump said it is not yet the right time to talk to China about trade, but eventually the US will be able to work out a deal with China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>German Foreign Minister said they are working to keep the Iranian transaction channels open while Iran said to expect the remaining partners in the nuclear agreement to operate more quickly and transparently. Also, the US said Iran&#39;s World Court filing on sanctions is an attempt to interfere with sovereign rights of the US. Elsewhere, Russian Foreign Ministry reported the new US sanctions will not force a change of path for Russia and will make dialogue difficult while Russian Finance Minister Siluanov announced the region has a range of measures in the event US sanctions target sovereign debt. In later trade, it was reported Syrian Air Defences are on full alert due to concerns of possible US strike as reported by Al Masdar. There were also mixed reports on Monday, with Yemeni TV reporting that Houthi rebels launched drones to target Dubai International Airport, though this story was denied by Emirati media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.8% at 2897, NDX +1.0% at 7559, DJI +1.0% at 26052.</strong> SECTORS: Energy +0.7%, Materials +1.4%, Industrials +1.2%, Cons Discretionary +0.7%, Cons Staples +0.1%, Healthcare +0.3%, Financials +1.4%, Tech +0.9%, Telecoms +0.4%, Utilities -0.7%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>Most sectors pushed higher on the back of U.S./Mexico trade talk progressions, primarily industrials where Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) made strong leads; automakers too, Ford (F) General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) being the biggest movers. The defensive utilities sector found itself dropping on the progressive sentiment. Chinese-based tech names (JD, BIDU, BABA, IQ) traded higher after the Chinese Central Bank intervened to stabilise the yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS: </strong>Advanced Micro Devices (ADM) led gains across the semis on the launch of its new Radeon Pro V340 graphics card to accelerate datacentre visualisation. Other names such as Micron (MU) and Intel (INTC) were supported by the news. Tesla (TSLA) was down on the day after CEO, Elon Musk over the weekend announced the automaker will remain public. Chipotle (CMG) suffered after being downgraded to underperform from neutral at Wedbush. CVS Health (CVS) and Kansas City Southern (KSU) enjoyed gains after the drug retailer announced the opening of a new distribution centre in Kansas City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES 15 CENTS HIGHER AT $68.87/BBL; BRENT (V8) SETTLES 39 CENTS HIGHER AT $76.21/BBL.</strong> Oil traded mostly higher on the day, with Brent outperforming WTI, as risk-sentiment improved supporting gains in equities and continued after the US and Mexico reached a trade deal replacing NAFTA. In news flow, adding upside pressure on prices, the OPEC+ monitoring committee said to anticipate July compliance at 109%, easing from the 120% in June and the 147% in May. Citi argues that the rate suggests limits on suppliers&rsquo; parts which could sound supportive for prices, though it notes supply has been increasing since talks easing supply limit began in May. Nonetheless, their argument is that &lsquo;supply may no longer be sufficient to cap prices as concern over US sanctions on Iranian crude oil exports mount&rsquo; and therefore they see the recent price upside to be driven by a shift in sentiment rather than recent developments in news or broader fundamentals. Elsewhere, IEA&#39;s Birol said to expect Venezuelan oil production to fall further, whilst Libya and Nigeria are seeing some improvement in oil production but remain fragile countries. Finally, OPEC and non-OPEC JTC are said to be planning another meeting before Algeria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-11:</strong> Treasuries were sold in the European morning in sympathy with bunds following a solid IFO report out of Germany. There was additional selling as the S&amp;P 500 hit fresh record highs, carrying on from last week. Additionally, selling action was spurred after the US and Mexico reached a bilateral trade deal. The US Treasury sold $36bln of 2-year notes with the high-yield coming in on the screws (2.655%). The participation metrics were in-line with recent auctions and saw average demand, with indirects taking the largest portion whilst dealers were awarded the biggest share since May and directs the smallest portion since February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PESO, CAD: </strong>Starkly contrasting fortunes for the MXN and TRY; After the US and Mexicans agreed a trade deal, the Peso strengthened, but came off highs as traders digested the obstacles that still remain in getting the deal done (it appears that Congress will need to ratify the deal). This lent some underlying support to the Loonie that, with Canadian negotiators heading to Washington on Tuesday to try and thrash out a deal. USDCAD back through 1.3000 and its 100 DMA at 1.2991 having climbed earlier to 1.3070 on the headline WTO filing by the US against Canadian paper duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>Lira has picked up where it left off ahead of Turkey&rsquo;s week-long holiday &ndash; on the back foot &ndash; with USTRY almost up to 6.3000 at one stage, and the country&rsquo;s woes highlighted by a sharp deterioration in manufacturing sentiment (to 96.4 in August from 102.7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, EUR: </strong>Ending Monday&rsquo;s UK holiday session at the top of the G10 ranks, albeit at least partly due to overall Greenback weakness as the DXY loses grip of 95.000 again, with Cable back up near 1.2900 having climbed above resistance at 1.2883 (21 DMA) and the single currency revisiting 1.2850 highs after clearing heavy&nbsp; expiry option-related flows at 1.1625 (2.4 bn) with the aid of a strong German Ifo survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, AUD, CHF: </strong>All benefiting from the aforementioned broad, but mainly MXN-inspired Buck downturn (note, Real also cheering the NAFTA news vs Rand and Ruble still suffering from strained US relations/sanctions), with USDJPY eyeing bids/support at 111.00 vs circa 111.35 at one stage, USDUSD bouncing ahead of 0.7300 towards 0.7350 and the Franc inching down towards 0.9800 vs 0.9845.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD: </strong>The &lsquo;major&rsquo; loser, or rather least able to glean traction from the latest USD retreat, with the Kiwi stuck under 0.6700 and AUDNZD rebounding through 1.0950 again.</p>\r\n",

General performance, however, has been mixed, Barclays points out, with four of the last seven auctions tailing. &nbsp;Domestic investors took down 48% at the July auction, higher than the takedown over the previous five months, the bank notes, while foreign bidders participation at 2s auctions continues to decline, falling to 8% takedown in July from 20% at the beginning of the year. In terms of set up, Barclays says that on-the-run 2s (Jul 2020s) trade rich on the curve compared to older 2s (Jun 2020s), particularly on a forward basis, which Barclays says suggest that they are not priced to trade special in the repo market, signalling room for the sector to set up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recent Auction History:</strong><br />- Tail (prev. 0.1bps, six-auction average: 0.1bps)<br />- High-yield (prev. 2.66%, six-auction average: 2.48%)<br />- Dealers (prev. 41%, six-auction average: 42%)<br />- Directs (prev. 14%, six-auction average: 14%)<br />- Indirects (prev. 45%, six-auction average: 43%)</p>\r\n",

Conversely, the Lira has picked up where it left off ahead of Turkey&rsquo;s week-long holiday, on the back foot, with Usd/Try almost up to 6.3000 at one stage, and the country&rsquo;s woes highlighted by a sharp deterioration in manufacturing sentiment (to 96.4 in August from 102.7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Monday&rsquo;s UK holiday session at the top of the G10 ranks, albeit at least partly due to overall Greenback weakness as the DXY loses grip of 95.000 again, with Cable back up near 1.2900 having climbed above resistance at 1.2883 (21 DMA) and the single currency revisiting 1.2850 highs after clearing heavy&nbsp; expiry option-related flows at 1.1625 (2.4 bn) with the aid of a strong German Ifo survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All benefiting from the aforementioned broad, but mainly Mxn inspired Buck downturn (note, Real also cheering the NAFTA news vs Rand and Ruble still suffering from strained US relations/sanctions), with Usd/Jpy eyeing bids/support at 111.00 vs circa 111.35 at one stage, Aud/Usd bouncing ahead of 0.7300 towards 0.7350 and the Franc inching down towards 0.9800 vs 0.9845.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;major&rsquo; loser, or rather least able to glean traction from the latest Usd retreat, with the Kiwi stuck under 0.6700 and Aud/Nzd rebounding through 1.0950 again.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were positive from early trade although gains in Australia were capped as financials lagged, while Tokyo stocks coat-tailed on early currency moves to reclaim the 22800 level where it eventually peaked.

        "content": "<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has rebounded from sub-1.1600/129.00 lows vs the Usd and Jpy respectively, while cementing gains above 0.9035 vs the Gbp in wake of Germany&rsquo;s August Ifo survey that beat consensus on all counts and was accompanied by upbeat comments from the institute&rsquo;s economist. However, the Eur still looks top heavy around chart resistance levels, like the 55DMA at 1.1615 and with big option expiry interest at 1.1625 (2.4 bn) also capping the upside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little respite for the Lira after the Turkish holidays as a fleeting glance above 6.0000 vs the Usd only seemed to give sellers additional psychological volition to flog the currency anew. Indeed, Usd/Try rallied to just shy of 6.2000 before the CBRT &lsquo;intervened&rsquo; via its daily FX depo to stem the tide, as investors re-establish bearish positions on all the well documented and still prescient negative factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The G10 laggards even though the Yuan is holding up relatively well and outperforming other EMs that are weakening alongside the Lira, with the Kiwi back below 0.6700 and Aud only just hovering above 0.7300 amidst more political upheaval overnight (resignation of Foreign Minister Bishop).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All marginally softer vs the Greenback as the DXY regains a firmer footing on the 95.000 handle post-Powell, with the Franc ranging between 0.9820-45, Loonie meandering from 1.3005-35 and above the 100 DMA at 1.2991, while Cable pivots 1.2850 amidst latest UK press reports warning about a hard Brexit and an extension to the deadline for talks to mid-November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also relatively constrained, albeit back under 111.00 vs the Usd and hemmed in by the 55 DMA (circa 111.01) and offers ahead of 111.50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MXN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EM outperformer as NAFTA talks are said to be nearing a conclusion and deal could be announced as soon as later today, Peso just off peaks vs its US counterpart around 18.7625.</p>\r\n",

In addition, the PBoC&rsquo;s resumption of the counter-cyclical factor in the CNY midpoint-fixing mechanism which is intended to reduce CNY volatility, had also weighed on the greenback. As such, most currencies have extended gains against USD but with price action across the major pairs contained amid a lack of data releases and ahead of the UK market closure. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses traded choppy in which they initially extended on gains before pulling back, while MXN outperformed after Trump tweeted a trade deal with Mexico could be reached soon and other reports noted an agreement could occur as early as today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC Governor Poloz commented that a gradual approach to monetary policy is appropriate amid digital disruption, while Poloz had previously commented that inflation is very close to target, that the rise is transitory and the outlook is for higher rates. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was detained in Moscow. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were quiet overnight as prices took a breather and held on to the majority of recent gains. This saw WTI crude futures flat amid fatigue from Friday&rsquo;s advances in which prices briefly rose above USD 69/bbl which was attributed to technical buying as well as reports that China&rsquo;s Unipec resumed US oil purchases. Elsewhere, gold plateaued at a 2-week high above the USD 1200/oz amid the recent pullback in the USD, while copper also remained firm amid a similar tone across the complex and alongside the positive risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes Rig Count: oil rigs -9 at 860, gas rigs -4 at 182, total rigs -13 to 1044; US drillers cut most oil rigs since May 2016. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Threat of tariffs in US crude is said to have spurred some buyers in China to purchase more crude from Libya, according to sources. (Platts)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran&rsquo;s Oil Minister Zanganeh said some members are interpreting the latest OPEC decision on oil output differently and are acting in accordance with policies of the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump asked Secretary of State Pompeo not to go to North Korea at this time as he feels they are not making significant progress on denuclearisation of the peninsula. Trump was also said to not believe China is helping with the process of denuclearisation and added that Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future which most likely will be after US trading relationship with China &#39;is resolved&#39;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was decent volume in the Treasury complex, as Jackson Hole got underway. Powell&rsquo;s comments were judged to be on the dovish side, which helped 10s catch a bid; Informa reported that traders priced in a pause after two more hikes, and then the real money bid came back forcing poorly placed shorts to cover. Unsurprisingly, curves continued to flatten with 2s10s and 2s30s finding their customary cyclical narrows. US 10-year T-notes settled 2+ tick lower at 120-16+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that a trade deal with Mexico could be reached soon, while there were separate reports which noted that US and Mexico were said to be poised for an agreement on NAFTA as soon as this Monday. In addition, there were comments from Mexico Economy Minister Guajardo that sides were practically in the final hours of negotiations. Conversely, Mexico Foreign Minister Videgaray said work on NAFTA with US has not finished and there had been source reports on Friday that Mexican President Elect Lopez Obrador&rsquo;s stance on oil was said to be keeping US and Mexico from securing a NAFTA deal.

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) were positive from early trade although gains in Australia were capped as financials lagged, while Tokyo stocks coat-tailed on early currency moves to reclaim the 22800 level where it eventually peaked. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+2.2%) and Shanghai Comp.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week mostly positive following the record closes for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Comp on Friday in US, where Fed Chair Powell reiterated a gradual approach at the Jackson Hole symposium and with sentiment also underpinned by hopes of a looming NAFTA-related agreement between US &amp; Mexico. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.7%) were positive from early trade although most the gains in Australia were later pared amid losses in financials, while Tokyo stocks coat-tailed on initial currency weakness to reclaim the 22800 level where it eventually peaked. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) also conform to the broad risk-appetite with the Hong Kong benchmark outperforming with nearly all its constituents in the green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, DXY remains subdued and just about held above the 95.00 level after last Friday&rsquo;s declines in the wake of Fed Powell&rsquo;s comments in which he reiterated a gradual approach and who also noted no clear signs of inflation accelerating above 2%. In addition, the PBoC&rsquo;s decision to resume the use of the counter-cyclical factor in the CNY midpoint-fixing mechanism which is intended to reduce CNY volatility, had also weighed on the greenback. As such, most currencies have extended gains against USD but with price action across the major pairs contained amid a lack of data releases and ahead of the UK market closure. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are choppy in which they initially extended on gains before pulling back, while MXN outperforms after Trump tweeted a trade deal with Mexico could be reached soon and other reports noted an agreement could occur as early as today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally. 10yr JGBs are flat with demand kept subdued amid gains in riskier assets and with a lack of Rinban operations by the BoJ.</p>\r\n",
