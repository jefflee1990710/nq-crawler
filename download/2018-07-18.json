EU&rsquo;s Juncker is set to meet US President Trump next week to discuss trade, and said he will explore the possibility of beginning negotiations to reduce autos tariffs with sources reporting later the EU is preparing rebalancing measures in case the tariffs on vehicles take place. NEC Director Kudlow gave an interview where he suggested that China wants to make a trade deal with the US, but he does not think China&rsquo;s President Xi has any intention of following through on trade reforms, and Kudlow believes Xi is &lsquo;holding up the process&rsquo; on trade talks; in late trade the White House said the administration &nbsp;is still in talks with China regarding trade. Elsewhere, US President Trump reiterated the US may do a separate trade deal with Mexico, and later may do one with Canada, however Guajardo then stated that moving from NAFTA to a bilateral trade agreement between the US and Mexico would be costly and effectively be similar to starting from scratch. He also said it is technically possible to reach a NAFTA deal before the next Mexican government takes office on December 1st and reiterated Mexico is looking for a three country NAFTA deal. The White House announced it sees a lot of progress on trade talks with Mexico, but is continuing both NAFTA tracks, including Canada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s George (Hawk) overnight said the FOMC can proceed with further, gradual hikes, though questioned exactly how far or fast the Fed needs to go; on the yield curve, she argued that an inversion was possible, but it might not portend a recession since the long-end of the curve has been distorted by the Fed&rsquo;s large balance sheet. In text of Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony to the House, was identical to his testimony to the senate on Tuesday. In the Q&amp;A Powell said the plan is to return the balance sheet to mainly treasuries over a three or four-year period, adding he has no intention of changing the pace of balance sheet reduction. On the shape of the yield curve, said short-end Treasury curve is moving on expectations of Fed rate hikes, but he is unsure what is going on in the long-end of the curve which he believes includes a market estimate of the neutral rate. Powell again observed a broad range of wage indicators have edged upwards, and expressed he is slightly concerned by lower inflation. On trade, he noted the effects of tariffs begin to be seen though no issues are flashing red in financial markets, as many financial asset prices are higher than normal. He mentioned that China&rsquo;s trading system is not as open that they would like, and emphasized trade should be free and fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US HOUSING STARTS:</strong> June&rsquo;s data was soft, with starts falling by just over 12% to 1.173mln, missing the consensus view. Analysts at Pantheon were sanguine, however, arguing that the decline was not as bad as it appeared, and pointed out that the key metric- single-family permits, actually rose by 0.8%, and that the headline was pulled down by the volatile multi-family component. &ldquo;Stepping back from the monthly noise, the key point here is that core single-family construction tends to move in line with new home sales; the trends in both have been about flat, more or less, since last fall,&rdquo; Pantheon said. &ldquo;Higher mortgage rates and slightly higher lending standards appear to be offsetting the favourable impact of rising employment. We expect no change in this story over the next few months. Housing market activity - sales and construction - likely has peaked for this cycle.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Villeroy (dove) said the ECB may raise rates from Summer 2019 at the earliest, and that the timing of the first rate hike will depend on the evolution of inflation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May appeared confident on Wednesday that a no deal Brexit is not getting closer and declined to say whether walking out of the EU with no deal would mean a hard border with Ireland. She emphasized the UK will tell businesses how to prepare for such a scenario, announcing the government is set to issue technical notifications between August and September. Later in the session, the UK Cabinet Minister said the Conservative party has come to its senses and reported they will all hang together on the Chequers deal. In late trade City AM reported EU Negotiators are reportedly considering extending Article 50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI CRUDE FUTURES (Q8) SETTLE 68C HIGHER AT USD 68.76/BBL; WTI CRUDE FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 59C HIGHER AT USD 67.75; BRENT CRUDE FUTURES SETTLE 74C HIGHER AT USD 72.90.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude was under pressure in early trade after data showed crude stocks posting a surprise build in the week, but turned around in afternoon trade, helped by news that Yemeni rebels struck a Riyadh refinery, causing a fire; Aramco said, however, that operations were not impacted and that the fire was due to an operational incident on their twitter account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEKLY INVENTORIES: </strong>Both the API and DOE reported a surprise build in crude stocks this week, with the latter on Wednesday reporting a build of 5.8mln against an expected draw of 3.6mln, Cushing stocks drew by 860k, less than the API reported. Products saw gasoline post a deeper than expected draw at 3.2mln, while distillate stocks saw a surprise draw of 371k. Meanwhile, crude output was up by 0.9% to 11mln BPD, a record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.22% at 2815, NDX -0.19% at &nbsp;7390, DJI +0.32% at 25201. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals: +0.03%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.70%, Energy: -0.02%, Financials: +1.25%, Health Care: +0.05%, Industrials: +1.05%, Materials: -0.01%, Telecoms: -0.26%, Tech: -0.10%, Utilities: -0.49%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was slapped with a record $4.34bln EU antitrust fine relating to making Google the default search engine on Android devices, limiting consumer choice; Google denied the charges and said it will appeal. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) was higher on speculation that the company may buyback its shares. Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) was initially lower after a lawyer for former CEO and founder, who was fired for using a racial slur, said that the company failed to properly investigate the transgression, and applied pressure on him to resign. However in late trade, WSJ reported that the name held merger talks with Wendy&#39;s (WEN), but talks did slowdown as the Chairman stepped down. This provided a boost to both PZZA and WEN, and PZZA closed in the green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Morgan Stanley (MS) beat on both top- and bottom-lines, and posted better than expected FICC revenues. Abbott Labs (ABT) topped profit estimates and bumped-up full year earnings guidance. CSX (CSX) topped the Street&rsquo;s estimates on cost cuts and pricing power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BROKER MOVES:</strong> Broadcom (AVGO) was downgraded at Goldman Sachs to neutral from buy, Paccar (PCAR) was downgraded to market perform at BNO, Twitter (TWTR) was downgraded to neutral and Macquarie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*M&amp;A: </strong>Pre market it was reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI) have amended the divestures agreement in response to the FCC Chair, and requests some divestitures be placed into trust and sold after the merger with Tribune (TRCO), and says this will eliminate the FCC&#39;s concerns with the sales to certain parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 2 TICKS LOWER AT 120-02.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were pretty much unchanged on Wednesday as action remained contained amid shy volume in the complex. Yields were mixed across the curve but changes were close to 1bps. In early trade, Treasury yields touched session lows pushing the yield curve at its flattest point in almost 11 years with 10yr yield at 2.850 on the back of a soft Housing Starts reading, which was the lowest in 9 months. The long end of the curve underperformed heading into the close. 2s30s widened by c.3bps whilst 2s10s, 2s5s widened by c.2bps at settlement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10-YEAR TIPS AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>After the softer-than-expected CPI data out of the US, along with oil prices softening, US breakevens steepened. Trade tensions provided some reprieve, though analysts at UBS says the 2-year implied core CPI (using 2-year CPI swaps at 222bp and gasoline futures backwardation) is already around 250-255bp: &ldquo;That suggests that the market is already priced for a decent size trade conflict.&rdquo; UBS argues that the 10-year TIPS auction could be very attractive on real yields. &ldquo;We see up to 5-10bp upside for breakevens over the coming year, but tactically, for the near-term, our breakeven inflation scorecard is bearish.&rdquo; And given the macro narrative of trade conflict, UBS expects the auction to go well. Results will be published just after 1pm EDT/1800 BST.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>The index and broad USD rally stalled on the back of considerably weaker than expected US housing starts and permits, but the DXY remained above the 95.000 handle after part 2 from Fed chair Powell (yesterday&rsquo;s upbeat text repeated) and amidst extended losses in counterpart currencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>More narrow escapes on the UK political front and for the Pound, as PM May only just survived another Brexit parliament vote, while Cable got to within 10 pips or so of 1.3000 having relinquished 1.3100 and taken out support around the previous YTD base (1.3050) following UK headline inflation which posted at 2.4% (Exp. 2.6%) and PPI misses. The aforementioned USD pull-back helped Sterling recover some losses, but not vs the GBP as the cross remained above 0.8900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD: </strong>The next weakest G10 links amidst latest global trade war developments, as the EU announced safeguards on steel imports for tomorrow and China stepped up its verbal threats to strike back against tariffs. The AUD was also undermined by a negative Aussie economic indicator overnight, but bounced from just under 0.7350 vs its US rival and the circa 0.7310 low for 2018 so far, while the Loonie also regained a degree of composure from 1.3250+ lows even though crude prices declined again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> The single currency largely shrugged off final Eurozone inflation data (headline metrics unrevised, but HICP tweaked lower), but was dragged down in sympathy with the GBP and others to test 1.1600 vs the USD before regrouping and trading right on hefty option expiries between 1.1625-35 (1 bn) in time for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Bucking the overall trend as US/China-EU etc &lsquo;tit-for-tat&rsquo; protectionism words and planned deeds ramped up, with USDJPY &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; back under 113.00 after a spike above topped out ahead of the YTD peak and chart resistance) and the Franc back from par-plus lows with offers from 1.0040-70 capping the pair alongside the 2018 high (1.0068).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Similar pattern as US/Majors, with extended losses registered vs the USD before some consolidation, with the Peso off worst levels following reports from NEC director Kudlow about progress in trade talks with Mexico, but the Lira hit by Turkey&rsquo;s decision to detain a US Pastor on suspicion of terrorist links. USDMXN around 19.0000 and USDTRY circa 4.8100. Elsewhere, the Yuan depreciated further on and off-shore, and through levels (6.70-75 vs the USD that prompted action from the Chinese authorities in the not distant past, but no sign of any intervention yet.</p>\r\n",

The aforementioned Usd pull-back helped Sterling recover some losses, but not vs the Gbp as the cross remained above 0.8900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next weakest G10 links amidst latest global trade war developments, as the EU announced safeguards on steel imports for tomorrow and China stepped up its verbal threats to strike back against tariffs. The Aud was also undermined by a negative Aussie economic indicator overnight, but bounced from just under 0.7350 vs its US rival and the circa 0.7310 low for 2018 so far, while the Loonie also regained a degree of composure from 1.3250+ lows even though crude prices declined again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency largely shrugged off final Eurozone inflation data (headline metrics unrevised, but HICP tweaked lower), but was dragged down in sympathy with the Gbp and others to test 1.1600 vs the Usd before regrouping and trading right on hefty option expiries between 1.1625-35 (1 bn) in time for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the overall trend as US/China-EU etc &lsquo;tit-for-tat&rsquo; protectionism words and planned deeds ramped up, with Usd/Jpy &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; back under 113.00 after a spike above topped out ahead of the ytd peak and chart resistance) and the Franc back from par-plus lows with offers from 1.0040-70 capping the pair alongside the 2018 high (1.0068).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar pattern as US/Majors, with extended losses registered vs the Usd before some consolidation, with the Peso off worst levels following reports from NEC director Kudlow about progress in trade talks with Mexico, but the Lira hit by Turkey&rsquo;s decision to detain a US Pastor on suspicion of terrorist links. Usd/Mxn around 19.0000 and Usd/Try circa 4.8100.

Note, the CNY and CNH have both fallen further below levels that previously sparked official intervention, partly by design via PBoC fixing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All conceding ground vs their US counterpart, with the former retreating to sub-0.7350 following a very weak Aussie leading index overnight (sub-zero reading), the Loonie breaking down through 1.3200 support that had been holding, with another downturn in oil prices hardy helping and the Kiwi revisiting 0.6750 having failed to sustain momentum at 0.6800+ recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also a victim of the buoyant Greenback and divergent yield/CB trends, with the single currency seriously testing 1.1600 bids after dipping through near term technical support around 1.1613.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both holding up relatively well vs other G10s, but still significantly softer vs the Usd as the Franc drops back under parity and the Jpy eyes ytd lows through 113.00 (113.39, but 200 WMA circa 113.29 capping for now).</p>\r\n",

However, dip buyers have prevented Bunds from declining any further thus far, with a bounce to 162.84 and then pretty dull sideways trade into the EU cash bourse opens awaiting more impetus. Data-wise, final Eurozone CPI is highly unlikely to impact, but long end German issuance may prompt some price action before attention reverts to the US for housing starts, permits and the 2nd performance from Powell.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) were higher with Australia led by miners including BHP after the industry giant posted strong Q4 iron ore production numbers, while Japanese exporters were lifted by favourable currency moves in which USD/JPY briefly rose above 113.00 for the first time since January. Hang Seng (+0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were also in the green amid the broad appetite for risk and after the PBoC conducted a 3rd consecutive daily net injection via reverse repos. However, gains were limited by continued weakness in blue chip energy names, while Xiaomi shares surged amid reports HKEX agreed with mainland exchanges on changes to Stock Connect inclusions which will ultimately allow shares with weighted voting rights to be included for Southbound trade.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House of Commons voted (307 to 301) to reject New Clause 18 of the Trade Bill which would have required the UK to make it a negotiating objective to establish a free trade area for goods with EU or enable UK participation in a customs union with the EU. (Newswires) The Times reports, that ahead of the vote, PM May threatened Conservative rebels with a general election this summer if they defeated her plans on customs after Brexit. (Times) Note, at 1500BST, PM May will stand before the Liaison Committee to answer questions regarding Brexit and her White Paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government stated it is planning a customs arrangement with the EU. In related news, the EU is to urge its members to prepare for a no deal Brexit, while there were separate reports that Irish PM Varadkar stated Ireland must step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit outcome although he believes that this scenario is unlikely. (Newswires/Telegraph/RTE)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is said to be exploring talks with US President Trump on car-tariff reduction. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, a lack of data during Asia-Pac hours kept currencies at levels seen towards the end of US trade in which the DXY held above the 95.00 level following the prior day&rsquo;s gains attributed to Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s upbeat comments on the economy and who also reiterated support among the FOMC for gradual rate hikes. As such, the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts languished near the prior day&rsquo;s lows with EUR/USD at a sub-1.1700 handle and GBP/USD briefly dipped below 1.3100 after PM May just about scraped through another day of voting in the House of Commons on the Trade Bill, in which MPs voted to reject the clause put forward by Remain rebels. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were subdued amid recent downside across metal and oil prices, as well as a firmer USD which coupled with outflows from the safe-haven JPY, underpinned USD/JPY to within a whisker of YTD highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly subdued overnight in which WTI crude futures slipped back below the USD 68.00/bbl level in late US trade after a surprise build in the latest headline API crude inventory data. Elsewhere, gold prices also languished after yesterday&rsquo;s 1.5% slump from intraday highs alongside a firmer USD and safe-haven outflows, while copper&#39;s attempts to nurse losses were somewhat futile alongside broad subdued tone across the complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (9 Jul) +0.629M vs. Exp. -3.600M (Prev. -6.795M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised NYMEX crude oil futures margins by 6.2% to USD 3450/contract for August, while it also raised NY Harbor heating oil futures margins by 7.7% to USD 4200/contract and increased RBOB gasoline futures margins by 10% to USD 4400/contract. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Citi raised long-term copper price forecast to USD 7500/ton from USD 7000/ton, while it stated that trade war is a long-term buying opportunity for copper and said to prepare for a decade of copper on steroids. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he accepts the intelligence which shows Russia meddled in US elections, while he also commented he hopes that Iran will eventually call them and possibly make a new deal or maybe not. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex settled lower on Tuesday in typically thin summer volumes, with the yield curve modestly bear-flattening, though yields were more-or-less unchanged. Some parts of the curve hit the flattest level in almost 11 years. Most of the action was concentrated in the front-end where the 2yr yield at its highest level in decade after Fed&rsquo;s Powell struck&nbsp;a positive tone on the US economy and avoided comments on the flattening yield curve on Tuesday, while again making upbeat comments on the economy, endorsing gradual hikes. Money markets are now pricing in an 89% probability of a rate hike in September. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 1+ ticks lower at 120-04.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s George (Non-Voter, Hawk) stated the US economy is in excellent condition and that monetary policy remains accommodative. Fed&rsquo;s George also stated that gradual rate hikes are required and uncertainty remains regarding speed and distance of Fed rate hikes. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is to discuss Chinese non-market trade policies with G7 officials on the sidelines of the G20. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Hatch said he may support a bill to curtail US President Trump&rsquo;s trade powers and reportedly threatened to push for such legislation if Trump proceeds with more tariffs.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade with a positive tone as momentum rolls over from US where all majors gained and the Nasdaq posted a fresh record high on tech outperformance, with sentiment also underpinned after upbeat comments from Fed Chair Powell. ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.0%) are higher with Australia led by miners including BHP after the industry giant posted strong Q4 iron ore production numbers, while Japanese exporters are lifted by favourable currency moves in which USD/JPY briefly rose above 113.00 for the first time since January. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.6%) are also positive amid the broad risk appetite and after the PBoC conducted a 3rd consecutive daily net injection via reverse repos. However, gains were limited by continued weakness in blue chip energy names, while Xiaomi shares surged amid reports HKEX agreed with mainland exchanges on adjusting inclusion for the stock connect which will ultimately allow weighted voting rights shares to be included for Southbound trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, a lack of data during Asia-Pac hours has kept currencies at levels seen towards the end of US trade with the DXY holding firm around the 95.00 level following the prior day&rsquo;s gains on upbeat comments on the economy by Fed Chair Powell, who also reiterated support among the FOMC for gradual rate hikes. As such, the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts languish near the prior day&rsquo;s lows with EUR/USD at a sub-1.1700 handle and with GBP/USD briefly dipping below 1.3100 after PM May just about scraped through another day of voting in the House of Commons on the Trade Bill, in which MPs voted to reject the clause put forward by Remain rebels that would have required the UK to target establishing a free trade area for goods with the EU or commit the UK to participate in a customs union with the EU. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were subdued amid recent downside across metal and oil prices, as well as a firm USD which coupled with outflows from the safe-haven JPY underpinned USD/JPY to within a whisker of YTD highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with focus centred on riskier assets and ahead of an enhanced liquidity auction for longer-dated bonds later.</p>\r\n",
