However, in later trade after the US and China announced intensifying trade talks and after US Trade Representative Lightizer said China tariffs have been placed on hold (later denied), risk-tone became more constructive with Treasuries moving to session lows as stocks moved higher. There where was little reaction after a decent retail sales report. There were some chatter that CTAs were covering shorts, helping to support the complex. The Treasury announced that it will sell USD 11bln in 10-year TIPS in next Wednesday&#39;s reopening, and it will sell USD 42bln 3-month bills and USD 35bln 6-month bills Monday. The curve was steeper at settlement with the exception of 2s5s. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 2 ticks higher at 118-26.</p>\r\n",

As a brief summary of the main events on Thursday, seven Cabinet members including ex-Brexit Negotiator Raab and Work and Pensions Secretary McVey resigned over the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement approved by the Cabinet on Wednesday evening. Environment Minister Gove and Secretary of State for International Development Mordaunt were also cited as potential ministers likely to resign, though at pixel time, have not made any such announcement. Reports doing the rounds suggested that around 30 letters have been submitted against PM May, still short of the 48 required to trigger a no confidence vote. Alongside this, the ERG appears divided in bringing down PM May, with Eurosceptic Tory leader Rees-Mogg being one of the members pushing for a confidence vote after submitting his letter; some had suggested the confidence vote could take place on Monday or Tuesday if enough letters are received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The Chinese commerce ministry announced in early trade that the US and China have resumed high level talks on trade. Reports in the FT suggested the two sides are to step up effort to strike G20 truce on trade to curb their trade war; US Trade Representative Lightizer has told some industry executives that the next tranche of China tariffs is already on hold, however, his office later denied these reports. Meanwhile, US Commerce Secretary Ross claimed the US is still planning to raise tariffs on China from 10% to 25% in January, and he does not expect a full China deal by that time and, adding that the meeting between Xi/Trump at the G20 summit is to focus on &quot;the big picture&quot;; Ross still, however, expects an eventual deal with China. In later trade, a US Administration official reiterated this this theme, saying it is unlikely that any breakthroughs on trade with China will be seen at the G20 summit at the end of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Powell said wages now in range reflecting inflation and productivity. Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish) highlighted that the Fed has been removing forward guidance statements because it is not certain about policy direction; he said that moving the inflation target makes him very nervous but still considers call for considering price-level target. He urged data dependency to avoid raising rates too fast or not far enough. He sees the neutral rate between 2.5% and 3.5% adding that the conditions warrant the &quot;final steps&quot; for implementing a neutral rate which is where we want to be. He expects the fiscal stimulus to fade by 2020 but economy to remain above potential for a few years. On trade, he noted tariffs increase prices with a 3-6 months lag; he has observed price increases but has seen no impact on inflation expectations; he added that businesses have told him they can manage 10% but not 25% tariffs and that they are delaying investment decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s chief economist Praet said monetary policy needs to remain accommodative, adding that in the euro area domestic demand remains robust and it can isolate itself from monetary policy. He noted that ending QE does not mean policy tightening and sees a Q4 rebound in German economy. On oil prices, he stated a decline is positive for the Eurozone if it can be sustained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Reports in La Stampa suggested Italian PM Conte is seeking to work with the EU on budget impasse whilst Deputy PM Di Maio said the government will continue with its path for the budget and was optimistic the government will raise over EUR 18bln from asset sales in 2019. Elsewhere, Italy&#39;s Deputy PM Advisor Borghi denied earlier reports that if the League were able to gain a majority at the next election, they will leave the Eurozone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANXICO </strong>hiked rates by 25bps as expected at its meeting on Thursday; the decision was not unanimous with one member looking for a 50bps hike. The central bank highlighted that monetary policy should respond with prudence if economic activity uncertainty increases considerably whilst noting that inflation is facing important risks related to the possible adoption of policies which structurally affect the process price formation in the economy. Banxico also claimed that the balance of risks to growth from a cyclical perspective continues to be tilted to the downside and sees currency exchange rate still under pressure both from higher external interest rates as well as from internal and external factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RETAIL SALES</strong> rose by 0.8%, above the expected 0.5% in October, representing the biggest increase since May. Gains were attributed to strong motor vehicles and parts sales as well as a 3% jump at gasoline stations and amid elevated energy prices which started the month at the highest level since June whilst control group sales signal a solid but more modest pace of consumer spending in Q4. Analysts at Wells Fargo expect a solid pace of consumption up to the end of the year, estimating a 4.5% increase in holiday sales compared to last year but anticipate further moderation in spending in the new year as &ldquo;x cuts will start to fade for consumers and amid rising prices and tighter monetary policy&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.06% at 2730, NDX +1.78% at 6890, DJI +0.83% at 25289. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +1.49%, Materials +1.43%, Industrials +1.26%, Cons Discretionary +0.01%, Cons Staples -0.34%, Healthcare +0.96%, Financials +1.46%, Tech +2.46%, Telecoms +0.62%, Utilities -0.77%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Cisco Systems (CSCO) surged today after reporting EPS above estimates and raising guidance. Apple (AAPL) pared back the previous days&rsquo; losses. Semiconductors also made a bounce back today, helping the wider tech sector make gains, with Micron Technology (MU), Broadcom (AVGO) and Applied Materials (AMAT) all top movers on the day. Walmart (WMT) reported EPS and comparable sales above estimates which initially saw it rise but soon pared back to moving into negative territory in later trade. Facebook (FB) traded lower amidst 10K filings from a range of hedge funds dissolving their stakes in the co. Amazon (AMZN) was another heavyweight down on the day. KB Home (KBH) was a bottom mover following it lowering revenue guidance spreading pessimism for other homebuilders such as D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar Corp (LEN).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.21 HIGHER AT USD 56.46/BBL, BRENT (F8) SETTLES USD 0.50 HIGHER AT USD 66.62/BBL.</strong> Crude prices edged slightly higher again on Thursday, rebounding from their recent sharp selloff and shrugging off rising weekly inventories. In news flow, Russia has cut production in November and stated that it wants to steer clear of OPEC oil production cuts. Analysts at Citi note that if a cut in production agreement between Saudi Arabia and Russia can be reached at the December 6th OPEC summit, &ldquo;there is a fundamental basis for at least some intermediate-term correction higher.&rdquo; The weekly EIA data saw crude stocks build by 10.27mln barrels (expectations were for 3.182mln), while oil&nbsp;production hit a record 11.7mln BPD. The market did not seem to fuss over this figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 2 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-26.</strong> Treasuries traded with a positive bias in choppy trade with Brexit news flow increasing appeal of safe-haven fixed income. However, in later trade after the US and China announced intensifying trade talks and after US Trade Representative Lightizer said China tariffs have been placed on hold (later denied), risk-tone became more constructive with Treasuries moving to session lows as stocks moved higher. There where was little reaction after a decent retail sales report. There were some chatter that CTAs were covering shorts, helping to support the complex. The Treasury announced that it will sell USD 11bln in 10-year TIPS in next Wednesday&#39;s reopening, and it will sell USD 42bln 3-month bills and USD 35bln 6-month bills Monday. The curve was steeper at settlement with the exception of 2s5s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> The Pound looks heads into APAC trade off of the worst levels, but still significantly weaker and by far the worst performer among major peers. The catalyst, ongoing UK Cabinet and Government conflict over the Brexit withdrawal draft and a raft of resignations including the Brexit Minister himself, Raab, Work and Pensions Secretary McVey. However, PM May delivered a staunch defence of the proposal in Parliament and at her press conference and appears to have initially survived the Cabinet meeting and presenting the deal to parliament, for now at least. Cable is currently back up to just beneath 1.2800 vs nigh on 1.2730 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD, JPY: </strong>All holding decent gains vs the Greenback, with the Aud encouraged by a big beat in Aussie payrolls overnight and unexpected dip in the unemployment rate, while the Kiwi rallied in its slipstream and Jpy rebounded further from recent lows as broad risk sentiment deteriorated. Aud/Usd held near the upper end of a 0.7300-0.7230 range, Nzd/Usd hovered above 0.6800 for the most part and Usd/Jpy drifted down towards 113.10 from 114.00+ earlier this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, CHF, EUR: </strong>Crude prices maintaining their recovery momentum and improved risk-tone sent Usd/Cad to 1.3170 from around 1.3250; weak Canadian home sales prevented the pair from breaching 1.3200 on the downside earlier in the session. Meanwhile, the Franc regained a safe-haven bid alongside the Jpy, and despite the DXY rebounding from circa 96.760 to 97.000+, with Usd/Chf back under 1.0100 and Eur/Chf sub-1.1400 even though the single currency was pretty resilient in its own right. Indeed, Eur/Usd reclaimed 1.1300+ status around the time that 1.5 bn option expiries rolled off, shrugging off latest Italian budget defiance.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound looks set to end Thursday&rsquo;s EU session off worst levels, but still significantly weaker and by far the worst performer among major peers. The catalyst, ongoing UK Cabinet and Government conflict over the Brexit withdrawal draft and a raft of resignations including the Brexit Minister himself, Raab, Work and Pensions Secretary McVey. However, PM May delivered a staunch defence of the proposal in Parliament and appears to have survived a no confidence attempt, for now at least, lead by ERG head Rees-Mogg. Cable is currently back up around 1.2800 vs nigh on 1.2750 at one stage, while Eur/Gbp has eased back from 0.8850+ towards 0.8830, but compared to 1.3030 and 0.8700 respectively before all the Whitehall backlash begun, and UK retail sales came in much worse the forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All holding decent gains vs the Greenback, with the Aud encouraged by a big beat in Aussie payrolls overnight and unexpected dip in the unemployment rate, while the Kiwi rallied in its slipstream and Jpy rebounded further from recent lows as broad risk sentiment deteriorated. Aud/Usd held near the upper end of a 0.7300-0.7230 range, Nzd/Usd hovered above 0.6800 for the most part and Usd/Jpy drifted down towards 113.10 from 114.00+ earlier this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie was relatively restrained and side-lined, with crude prices maintaining their recovery momentum and keeping Usd/Cad capped around 1.3250, but Canadian home sales weak and preventing the pair from breaching 1.3200 on the downside. Meanwhile, the Franc regained a safe-haven bid alongside the Jpy, and despite the DXY rebounding from circa 96.760 to 97.000+, with Usd/Chf back under 1.0100 and Eur/Chf sub-1.1400 even though the single currency was pretty resilient in its own right. Indeed, Eur/Usd reclaimed 1.1300+ status around the time that 1.5 bn option expiries rolled off, shrugging off latest Italian budget defiance.</p>\r\n",

Cable collapsed from 1.3000+ through 1.2900 and the recent 1.2828 low to circa 1.2750 at one stage, with only the November base at 1.2696 protecting the ytd trough (1.2662) aside from any psychological or sentimental support at 1.2700. Meanwhile, Eur/Gbp rallied from around 0.8700 to 0.8845, breaching some interim chart resistance at 0.8766 on the way, and without much effort, before partially retracing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - Although the single currency is benefiting from the Gbp&rsquo;s demise, it has lost ground vs the Usd after running into offers at 1.1350, but is holding in well above recent lows not far from 1.1200 and may be relatively contained by hefty option expiries at 1.1300 and 112.50-60 in 1.5 bn and 1.6 bn respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The clear G10 outperformer and retaining the bulk of its overnight gains vs the Greenback on the back of an upbeat Aussie jobs report &ndash; Aud/Usd currently around 0.7260 within a 0.7300-0.7230 range, and with the Aud/NZD cross back above 1.0650 as the Kiwi pivots 0.6800 against the Usd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The Dollar is mixed vs major counterparts and broadly weaker against EM currency, but the index has rebounded firmly above 97.000, largely due to the aforementioned Pound rout and knock-on effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.9%) prices have extended gains above USD 1200/oz as the dollar continues to fall from the 16-month highs that were reached at the start of the week. Separately, copper has been boosted following China sending a written response to US trade reforms, although it has been noted that it offers insufficient concessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-0.1%) and WTI (-0.2%) initially traded higher, and were mostly unaffected by the larger than expected build in API inventory. but have since reverted into negative territory following the dollar beginning to strengthen again. Of note reports that Russia have cut oil output to 11.38mln BPD for the first two weeks of November. Markets will be looking ahead to the EIA weekly data later today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (9 Nov) +8.79mln vs. Exp. +3.2mln (Prev. +7.8mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Cushing Number (9 Nov) +0.726mln (Prev. +3.073mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Gasoline Stocks (9 Nov) +0.188mln (Exp. -1.5mln, Prev. -1.2mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Distillate Stocks (9 Nov) -3.224mln (Exp. -1.7mln, Prev. -3.64mln)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK bond continue to hold a hefty advantage and political premium amidst all the post-Brexit draft resignations and recriminations, but did meet a band of offers/chart resistance at the 123.15 contract high (+133 ticks on the day), and then suffered a degree of supply indigestion as the DMO&rsquo;s 2037 auction came with a very lengthy tail and was not that well covered. However, Gilts remained around one full point ahead vs Bunds now some 50 ticks up vs +74 ticks at best (160.88 Eurex high) and US Treasuries that are only partially maintaining a safe-haven bid having seen some big clip buying (40k lots in 10s for example) earlier. Ahead, a pretty packed US agenda including retail sales data, weekly claims and the Philly Fed, plus another raft of Fed speakers, with chair Powell slated again.</p>\r\n",

However, Gilts remained around one full point ahead vs Bunds now some 50 ticks up vs +74 ticks at best (160.88 Eurex high) and US Treasuries that are only partially maintaining a safe-haven bid having seen some big clip buying (40k lots in 10s for example) earlier. Ahead, a pretty packed US agenda including retail sales data, weekly claims and the Philly Fed, plus another raft of Fed speakers, with chair Powell slated again.</p>\r\n",

The 10 year debt future has been up to 122.80, +98 ticks, having gapped up 23 ticks initially and dipping to 122.01 fleetingly, while the 3 month strip is now 10 ticks ahead at best, and Bunds continue to tag along, at 160.67, +53 ticks. Looming long end DMO supply could halt or at least stall the rally in core bonds, but in the current climate perhaps not for long, while retail sales data may be quickly dismissed given its propensity for being erratic, and in the face of everything else.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) were lower throughout most the session as financials lagged although the Australian benchmark staged a late rebound and just about turned positive at the close, while sentiment in Tokyo remained pressured by a firmer currency and as blue-chip banking stocks declined post-earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) weathered a choppy start as outperformance in tech kept Chinese markets afloat after a beat on earnings from Hong Kong index-giant and China&rsquo;s largest tech firm Tencent Holdings. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with only minimal support seen despite the losses in Tokyo stocks and with price action also muted following mixed results in today&rsquo;s 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s government is said to have sent a written response to the US concerning trade reforms, which reports noted offered insufficient concessions.

In related news, the government summary of the draft withdrawal agreement suggested a role for parliament in deciding whether to extend the transition or to move in to the backstop, while the UK will guarantee avoiding a hard border including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls with the EU and UK to establish a single customs territory in which Northern Ireland will be in the same customs territory as Great Britain. (Newswires) Recent reports suggest that the Parliamentary meaningful vote on Brexit could take place on December 18th</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier said Brexit deal is the determining step to conclude negotiations and commented that the transition period can be extended &quot;for a limited period&quot;, while he also commented that the solution to avoid a hard border in Ireland has been found and that the future relationship will be on a basis of duty and quota-free trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ERG Head Jacob Rees-Mogg urged other conservative lawmakers not to vote for UK PM May&#39;s deal, while he earlier said PM May could face an &#39;accidental&#39; confidence vote and it was suggested that a lot of people feel very let down and without any organisation might be writing letters. Furthermore, the ERG is said to be frustrated and angry but still hopes PM May will think again and views the deal she is proposing as unlikely to pass. (Twitter/Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were reports that UK PM May no confidence vote would be submitted today, although a BBC reporter also stated that it does not look like there are enough letters to spark a challenge to UK PM May yet, though more could be on their way. A Times reporter suggested the ERG have now switched position and support letters of no confidence in UK PM May, although ERG Head Jacob Rees Mogg said he had not called for a confidence vote. (BBC/Twitter/Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BuzzFeed senior political correspondent tweeted that UK PM &#39;May requested meeting with Corbyn which the correspondent suggested was a bold move and openly shows that Labour support is needed to get the deal through. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DUP&#39;s Wilson said if UK PM May&#39;s deal fails to get Parliament support her &#39;neck would be on the line&#39; but parliament vote to bring down government is unlikely, while Wilson later commented that people will be appalled by this deal and that no deal is better than a bad one. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Trade Commissioner Malmstrom said there is no decision yet on auto tariffs and shares criticism that US voiced on China, while Malmstrom also commented the EU has a retaliation tariff list ready if the US imposes autos tariffs on EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD was relatively flat overnight as comments from Fed Chair Powell failed to provide any fresh insights, in which he noted that having a press conference after every meeting means all meetings are live and that the Fed is trying to avoid hiking too slowly or too fast. GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.3000 handle to the upside after UK PM May received Cabinet approval for her Brexit plan, but with gains capped due to uncertainty if the deal could be passed through Parliament and as some also touted a potential confidence vote. Elsewhere, the cautious risk tone saw JPY hold on to the prior day&rsquo;s safe-haven flows and AUD/USD outperformed following better than expected job numbers from Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Employment Oct 32.8k vs. Exp. 20.0k (Prev. 5.6k, Rev. 7.8k). (Newswires)<br />Australian Unemployment Rate Oct 5.0% vs. Exp. 5.1% (Prev. 5.0%)<br />Australian Participation Rate Oct 65.6% vs. Exp. 65.5% (Prev. 65.4%, Rev. 65.5%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with WTI crude futures lacklustre overnight despite having snapped its record losing streak the prior day. Oil prices were momentarily pressured after the latest API inventory report showed a larger than expected build in crude stockpiles, although the downside was only brief and WTI then flatlined around USD 56.00/bbl during the session. Elsewhere, gold was uneventful which largely reflected a muted greenback, while copper saw mild gains amid the China-led turnaround in sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (9 Nov) +8.79mln vs. Exp. +3.2mln (Prev. +7.8mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised December NYMEX crude oil futures margins by 14.5% to USD 3550/contract. (Newswires)<br /><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries ended the session only marginally higher, once again opposing the move in equities which ended in the red on Wednesday. The complex found some sellers ahead of the US CPI report which was broadly in line and traded just off highs after UK PM May received backing on her proposed Brexit deal. The curve was steeper at the close with yields lower by c.3bps at settlement. 5s30s and 2s30s were wider by c.2bps. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 7+ ticks higher at 118-24.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />Fed Chair Powell (Neutral) said having a press conference after every meeting means all meetings are live, while he added he is very happy about the state of the economy and that there is good reason to think economy will continue in a positive way. Fed Chair Powell also commented that the Fed is trying to avoid hiking too slowly or too fast and that challenges include how much further to hike and at what pace, while he further stated that trade dispute could mean slower growth and a little higher inflation if more products face tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Quarles (Voter, Neutral) said the labour market sustainable and the economy very strong, while he added US can continue strong economy for some time. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House has deliberately curtailed trade advisor Peter Navarro&#39;s public role amid tensions with top economic advisor Larry Kudlow according to sources, while there were separate reports that US National Security Adviser Bolton&rsquo;s senior aide Mira Ricardel was moved out of&nbsp;White House&nbsp;amid feud with the First Lady&rsquo;s office.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets were eventually mostly higher after the region gradually shrugged off the cautious lead from the losses stateside, where weakness in tech and financials saw all US majors finish in the red. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) were lower throughout most the session as financials lagged although the Australian benchmark staged a late rebound and just about turned positive at the close, while sentiment in Tokyo remained pressured by a firmer currency and as blue-chip banking stocks declined post-earnings. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) weathered a choppy start as outperformance in tech kept Chinese markets afloat after a beat on earnings from Hong Kong index-giant and China&rsquo;s largest tech firm Tencent Holdings. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat with only minimal support seen despite the losses in Tokyo stocks and with price action also muted following mixed results in today&rsquo;s 5yr JGB auction.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets are mixed with sentiment somewhat cautious following the uninspired performance of their counterparts stateside, where losses in tech and financials saw all US majors close in the red. ASX 200 (-0.5%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are lower as financials also underperform in both indices and with blue-chip banking stocks in Tokyo dampened post-earnings, while a firmer currency has added to the pressure for Japanese exporters. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.7%) weathered a choppy start as outperformance in tech kept Chinese markets afloat following a beat on earnings from Hong Kong index-giant and China&rsquo;s largest tech firm Tencent Holdings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD is relatively flat with the greenback consolidating below the 97.00 level after comments from Fed Chair Powell failed to provide any fresh insights in which he noted that having a press conference after every meeting means all meetings are live and that the Fed is trying to avoid hiking too slowly or too fast. GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.3000 handle to the upside after UK PM May received Cabinet approval for her Brexit plan, but with gains capped due to uncertainty whether this could be passed in Parliament and as some also touted a potential confidence vote. Elsewhere, the cautious risk tone saw JPY hold on to the prior day&rsquo;s safe-haven flows and AUD/USD outperformed following better than expected job numbers from Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat with only minimal support seen despite the losses in Tokyo stocks, as participants remain sidelined ahead of a 5yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
