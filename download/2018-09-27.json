Amazon (AMZN) was lifted on a price target increase at Stifel to a street high as well as on the opening of its first 4+ start retail online store in New York. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was higher after it announced&nbsp; the launch of its Candy Crush Friends Saga worldwide scheduled for October.

Curve flattening was once again the theme, with a large block flattener in 5s30s reported which helped the long-end of the curve rise off lows. The 7s auction was lacklustre, tailing 0.9bps, and saw the highest stop-out rate since April 2010. Cover was below recent averages, and primary dealer takedown was above recent averages; in wake of the auction, the long-end continued to hold its bid. US T-note futures (Z8) settle half-a-tick higher at 118-24.</p>\r\n",

Italy&rsquo;s Di Maio welcomed the &ldquo;budget for the people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson says China is open to US negotiations to resolve trade issues, adding that extreme US pressure won&#39;t cripple Chinese Economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> An EU Commission spokesman said there is no need for &quot;horror stories&quot; about EU preparations for a no-deal Brexit. Separately, EU Chief Brexit Negotiator said, following a meeting with UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, that he continues to listen to all views on Brexit and to explain the position of the EU, aiming for an orderly UK withdrawal and an ambitious future partnership together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&#39;s Haldane said that UK growth is steady around the trend rate, noting we are now at point where the UK output gap is close to be eliminated, and the UK can no longer afford to run the economy hot. He added the impact of rate hikes so far has been modest, though the UK growing at current pace would require more hikes. Finally, Haldane stated the appropriate policy response to a disorderly Brexit would depend on markets, demand and currency, and argued that it would be genuinely two-sided on how the BoE could react to a disorderly Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&rsquo;s Praet said that at this stage of the cycle, careful monitoring of the risk-taking channel of monetary policy is important, and says no evidence of excessive misalignment across Euro Area asset classes. Signs that valuations are stretched in specific market segments incoming data continues to support the ECB&rsquo;s confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US Q2 FINAL GDP</strong> confirmed growth at 4.2%, as private inventories downward revision was offset by modest upward revisions to most other components. Looking at the breakdown, sales growth was revised slightly higher to 5.4% from 5.3% and Prices to 2.0% from 1.9%. The GDP Deflator also came in strong and rose by more-than-expected 3.3% (cons 3.0%). Analysts at Oxford Economics notes momentum looks very firm heading into H2 2018, with real GDP up 2.9% y/y in Q2&rsquo;, though, it notes, the pace of expansion may moderate as the fiscal stimulus effects start to fade, inflation strengthens and trade uncertainty weighs on activity. Overall their forecast is for an average real GDP of just under 3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US DURABLE GOODS</strong> rebounded in August at an increase of 4.5% MM vs. Exp. increase of 2%, compared to July&rsquo;s drop of 1.2%. Wells Fargo noted that the report pointed to a more pessimistic near-term business spending outlook, but stronger equipment spending, government spending and inventories. Big components of the total orders move were a 69% increase in aircraft and 44% increase in defence. Wells also noted that equipment spending appears to be calming its pace in comparison to 2017 with core capital goods ex-aircraft falling 0.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PENDING HOME SALES: </strong>US Pending Home Sales: fell to -0.5% MM in August, a decrease of 1.8%. Pantheon Macro highlights how the figure has now declined four times out of the past five months and the index is now at its lowest in four years. They also state how the index is weaker than it is implied by the lagged path of mortgage applications, potentially leaving room for a rebound in the near future, but overall the figures support their view that the US housing market activity is trending lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.28% at 2914, NDX +0.88% at 7630, DJI +0.21% at 26440. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.05%, Materials -0.98%, Industrials +0.13%, Cons Discretionary +0.54%, Cons Staples -0.20%, Healthcare +0.44%, Financials -0.33%, Tech +0.54%, Telecoms +0.80%, Utilities +0.96%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Apple (AAPL) led the Dow on the news that JP Morgan sees a 23% upside in their shares and initiated the stock with an Overweight rating. Amazon (AMZN) was lifted on a price target increase at Stifel to a street high as well as on the opening of its first 4+ start retail online store in New York. Activision Blizzard (ATVI) was higher after it announced &nbsp;the launch of its Candy Crush Friends Saga worldwide scheduled for October. Alaska Air (ALK) was the top gainer in the SPX after announcing a daily nonstop service to El Paso, Texas scheduled for 2019 as well as an upgrade at Imperial Capital. Carnival (CCL) sunk after earnings came short of expectations, dragging its peers Royal Caribbean (RCL) Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH)&nbsp; in negative territory; Conagra (COG) also suffered losses after disappointing figures and Accenture (ACN) dipped it forecasted fiscal 2019 profits below estimates. Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) was down after signing an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Grasberg mine to Indonesia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES $0.55 HIGHER AT $72.12/BBL, BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.38 HIGHER AT $81.72/BBL.</strong> The crude complex has shrugged-off bearish commentary made by US Energy Sec Perry on Wednesday, after he suggested that the US would not release reserves from the SPR. Crude also shrugged-off news that Saudi Arabia plans to boost oil supply by 200-300k BPD in the next two-months to compensate for lower Iranian output, sources said. Later in the day, Oil Movements research was doing the rounds, and the consultancy expects OPEC oil shipments to dip by 400k BPD to 25.01mln BPD in the 4 weeks to 13/Oct versus period to 15/Sept.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE HALF-A-TICK HIGHER AT 118-24.</strong> The T-Note traded within a range, but action was being dictated by the European fixed income complex for much of the day, with sellers emerging after Bunds yields rose in European trade, with some profit-taking and dealer positioning ahead of the 7-year auction cited. Curve flattening was once again the theme, with a large block flattener in 5s30s reported which helped the long-end of the curve rise off lows. The 7s auction was lacklustre, tailing 0.9bps, and saw the highest stop-out rate since April 2010. Cover was below recent averages, and primary dealer takedown was above recent averages; in wake of the auction, the long-end continued to hold its bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> More choppy trade post-Fed, but ultimately the index and broad USD is grinding higher vs G10 counterparts on the prospect or rather renewed guidance for further policy normalisation through to 2020, but also as a bi-product of weakness elsewhere, especially in the EUR, due to Italian budget tensions. The DXY is currently just over 94.80 vs 94.207 at the low and not far from 94.000 pre-FOMC yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF:</strong> Among the major laggards all day, as the Franc extends losses vs the Dollar above 0.9750 and breached 1.1400 to the upside versus EUR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, EUR: </strong>The next biggest losers against the Greenback on US-China trade-related contagion and ongoing Italian budget divisions ahead of potentially key meetings pencilled in for later today, assuming no delays or postponements as the wrangle over the 2019 deficit and apparent difference of opinions seemingly grows even wider (Economy Minister Tria sticking to sub-2% vs demands for up to 2.6%). AUD/USD tested bids ahead of 0.7200, rising above the figure, while EUR/USD only just holding above a series of moving averages from around 1.1665 having failed to maintain recovery gains above 1.1700 on firmer than forecast German inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, JPY: </strong>All in the region of 0.5% adrift vs their US peer (or rival), with the Kiwi retreating further from post-RBNZ peaks circa 0.6675 to around 0.6625 as OCR guidance was left neutral and unlike the Fed tightening is not envisaged until late 2020, assuming no cut first if needed. USD/JPY held some way ahead of technical support and decent option expiry interest (112.35 and 112.40-50 in 1.1 bn) to retest resistance around 113.00 following yet more dovish talk from BoJ Governor Kuroda, and breaching the level to the upside in afternoon trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie derived some traction from a pick-up in Canadian average earnings and upward revision to back data, ahead of BoC&rsquo;s Poloz aftermarket, and eventually rebounded through 1.3050 as NAFTA relations with the US appear to be as poor as ever, if not worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable managed to hold above 1.3100 after latest encouraging rhetoric from the EU on Brexit deal negotiations and recovered lost ground vs the Eur to revisit 0.8900, and has consolidated around those levels as we enter APAC trade, though derived little independent impetus from BoE&rsquo;s Haldane, who did not divulge much at all on the policy outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>In stark contrast to the overall Dollar bid trend, several regional currencies clawed back more lost ground, with the ZAR now not far from 14.0000, and TRY breaching 6.00 (on speculation about Turkey releasing US Pastor Brunson, potentially).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The US Treasury will auction USD 93bln in 2s (USD 37bln on Monday), 5s (USD 38bln on Tuesday) and 7s (USD 31bln on Thursday); with USD 13bln maturing at the end of the week. The US will also sell USD 17bln of 2yr FRN this week. This week brings approx. USD 93bln of redemptions and approx. USD 8bln of coupon payments. The FOMC rate decision has set the tone for Thursday&rsquo;s 7-year auction, with analysts noting that the recent sell-off of Treasuries has lifted the 7s yield to above 3%, making the WI yield cheaper compared to the previous stop-out rate, which analysts say could provide support. In addition, Societe Generale says that any short-covering from the record net shorts from leveraged funds in the TY futures could also provide support, while the auction may also benefit from month-end extensions. The 7-year has also cheapened on the fly over the last fortnight vs 5s and 10s, which could be a positive. SocGen holds a slightly positive bias going into the auction.</p>\r\n",

The DXY is currently just over 94.700 vs 94.207 at the low and not far from 94.000 pre-FOMC yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the major laggards all day, but ending Thursday&rsquo;s EU session as the clear underperformer as the Franc extends losses vs the Dollar towards 0.9750 and not that far from 1.1400 vs the Eur even though the single currency is weak in its own right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next biggest losers against the Greenback on US-China trade-related contagion and ongoing Italian budget divisions ahead of potentially key meetings pencilled in for later today, assuming no delays or postponements as the wrangle over the 2019 deficit and apparent difference of opinions seemingly grows even wider (Economy Minister Tria sticking to sub-2% vs demands for up to 2.6%). Aud/Usd now testing bids ahead of 0.7200 and Eur/Usd only just holding above a series of Mas from around 1.1665 having failed to maintain recovery gains above 1.1700 on firmer than forecast German inflation data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/JPY/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in the region of 0.3-0.35% adrift vs their US peer or rival, with the Kiwi retreating further from post-RBNZ peaks circa 0.6675 to around 0.6625 as OCR guidance was left neutral and unlike the Fed tightening is not envisaged until late 2020, assuming no cut first if needed. Usd/joy held some way ahead of technical support and decent option expiry interest (112.35 and 112.40-50 in 1.1 bn) to retest resistance around 113.00 following yet more dovish talk from BoJ Governor Kuroda. The Loonie derived some traction from a pick-up in Canadian average earnings and upward revision to back data, ahead of BoC&rsquo;s Poloz, but failed to rebound through 1.3050 as NAFTA relations with the US appear to be as poor as ever, if not worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable managed to hold above 1.3100 after latest encouraging rhetoric from the EU on Brexit deal negotiations and recovered lost ground vs the Eur to revisit 0.8900, but derived little independent impetus from BoE&rsquo;s Haldane who did not divulge much at all on the policy outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stark contrast to the overall Dollar bid trend, several regional currencies clawed back more lost ground, with the Zar now not far from 14.0000, Try back above 6.0000 (on speculation about Turkey releasing US Pastor Brunson, potentially) and the Rub up over 66.0000 (against the backdrop of still firm Brent).</p>\r\n",

Reports suggested the Italian Government may postpone their 2019 budget plan meeting and the league were set to join 5SM in seeking a 2.4% deficit target, this came amid reports that FinMin Tria was set to resign over disagreements on the budget but this was later denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this denial, Salvini said that it is &quot;obviously&quot; worth having a deficit above 2%/GDP, and the announcement that a meeting was scheduled at 10:30am to discuss the budget alongside the Italian Budget Target meeting being pushed back to 7:00pm BST. This came amid further reports that the Italian Finance Minister is ready to resign and sticking to a target deficit/GDP of 1.6%. The ruling parties are in agreement and want a debt/GDP above 2%, as according to a 5 Star source. (Corriere Della Sera/La Stampa/ANSA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he rejected a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian PM and added the US is not getting along at all with Canadian negotiators. However, Canadian PM Trudeau spokesman later said Trudeau did not request a one-on-one meeting after (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USTR Lightizer plans to tell Congress that upcoming talks with Japan are just one item on a list of new negotiations and that he wants to submit notification for negotiations with the EU, Philippines and the UK, according to WSJ citing sources. In related news, the text of US-Mexico trade deal expected to be released today; the deal has been written to allow Canada to join later as according to sources.

Moreover, BTPs have gleaned some comfort or at least sighed relief in the knowledge that nervous investors did not shun the latest cash offering, but the 10 year benchmark remains below 126.00. Elsewhere, Gilts continue to track Bunds within tighter confines and recently slipped back below 121.00, to 120.93 (+14 ticks vs +51 ticks at one stage), while US Treasuries are consolidating and unwinding a degree of bull-flattening after the Fed and in front of a pretty packed penultimate session before the end of September (from the trading standpoint). Aside from a raft of data and more from Powell, plus Kaplan, the 7 year auction could be interesting given mixed impulses via softer yields/less concession vs more clarity regarding the FOMC outlook.</p>\r\n",

The single currency has derived some underlying support from firmer than expected German state CPI reports implying an upside skew to the national print, while hefty option expiry interest at 1.1700-05 (1.35 bn) may also be keeping the headline pair afloat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/AUD/CHF/CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major underperformers against the Greenback, partly on Fed policy guidance reaffirming a final and 4th 25 bp hike this year, followed by 3 more in 2019 and another the year after, but also on other factors. Cable is teetering above 1.3100 as Brexit uncertainty persists, while Aud/Usd is slipping from the 0.7250 level that has been pivotal amidst the ongoing US-China trade rift. The Franc is only just holding circa 0.9700 and around 1.1350 vs the Eur, conscious that the SNB will be watching out for any Roman repercussions and ready to intervene if the Chf strengthens excessively on safe-haven grounds. Elsewhere, the Loonie has lost much of its crude traction following latest NAFTA news that suggests little prospect of a deal anytime soon, with Usd/Cad up over 1.3050 ahead of Canadian average weekly earnings data and a speech from BoC&rsquo;s Poloz later tonight, while the Kiwi only got a fleeting boost from a relatively upbeat RNBZ assessment of the economy and core inflation as the OCR outlook remained neutral. Hence, Nzd/Usd has reverted to its 0.6650 axis and veering south. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holding up much better than the rest in contrast to recent sessions, even though BoJ Governor Kuroda has maintained a dovish stance with powerful easing still appropriate, and it appears that technical impulses may be impacting after the latest rejection of 113.00+ levels. The headline pair retreated towards 112.50 before finding some underlying bids ahead of a 112.35 Fib and a decent expiry between 112.50-40 (1.1 bn), while Eur/Jpy topped out in advance of 133.00 and a quadruple top just above the big figure.</p>\r\n",

Indeed, the 10 year German benchmark has inched a tad higher to 158.79 (+3/4 point) and technically could trip buy-stops amidst more pronounced selling in Italian bonds. Market contacts note that nearest upside chart targets for Bunds are 155.88-90, which incidentally were prevalent before ECB President Draghi uttered the vigorous word in conjunction with underlying inflation. Back to the UK, and 3 month contracts are also firmer with the long end outperforming in line with the Eurodollar curve on unchanged Fed dot plots flagging 5 more 25 bp hikes to 2020. Ahead, BoE speak slated from Governor Carney and chief economist Haldane.</p>\r\n",

The situation in Rome remains very uncertain and fluid amidst further speculation and denials that Finance Minister Tria has offered or rather threatened to resign amidst pressure from the League and 5-Star to push the deficit to 2.4% vs sub-2%, and to top it all there is another hefty slug of debt issuance to consider. Away from Italy, preliminary German CPI data, pan Eurozone sentiment indices and ECB speakers all on the docket ahead of month/quarter/Japanese half year end tomorrow, with index durations above average. Back to Eurex, Bunds are 60 ticks ahead within a 158.70-54 range vs yesterday&rsquo;s 158.04 close, with 10 year BTPs over a full point adrift at worst sub-126.00.</p>\r\n",

The Fed removed the reference in its statement that policy is &#39;accommodative&#39;, while it stated it sees gradual hikes and that risks to the economy &#39;roughly balanced&#39;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Aside from the &ldquo;accommodative&rdquo; removal, the statement was little changed and the dot plot showed rate hike projections were also unchanged from June, although the Fed&#39;s new 2021 dot estimated rates are to be between 3.25-3.50% which matches its 2020 projection. This hints that the FOMC has put an end date to its hiking cycle and suggests the FOMC does not intend to raise rates above its estimate of neutral (neutral rate estimates are between 2.50-3.50%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Core PCE inflation forecasts were unchanged across the board, while real GDP forecasts were raised for this year and next year to 3.1% (Prev. 2.8%) and 2.5% (Prev. 2.4%) respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- At the press conference Powell noted dropping the &#39;accommodative&#39; language is a sign that monetary policy is proceeding in line with expectations and does not signal rate path change. He also sees positive signs of a strong economy and that growth outlook remains favourable with fiscal stimulus boosting the economy; says gradual normalisation helping to sustain US economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Furthermore, Powell noted that if inflation surprises to the upside, the Fed would have to move quicker but stressed he did not see that happening while he also added trade was a downside risk, though the effects of trade tensions have been relatively small so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- There was a mixed reaction to the FOMC which was initially perceived as dovish due to the dot plots which suggested no more hikes after 2020 and that the Fed will refrain from going above the neutral rate. However, the dollar then found support and stocks were pressured on Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s comments on the economy at the press conference which sounded upbeat about economic prospects and defined this as a particularly bright moment for the US economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks were indecisive following a lacklustre lead from Wall St. where the major bourses ended the day with losses after a mixed-perceived FOMC.

(Corriere Della Sera)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback stabilised overnight from post-FOMC volatility, while EUR/USD was little changed and GBP/USD tested 1.3150 to the downside amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty. NZD/USD initially strengthened after a relatively upbeat RBNZ interest rate decision where the central bank kept rates unchanged and saw early signs of an increase in core inflation, while it also stated that the outlook for OCR assumes growth will pick up over the coming year. However, the gains were short-lived as the RBNZ reiterated that they expect to keep the OCR at the current level into 2020. Elsewhere, USD/CAD reached session highs after US President Trump said he rejected a one-on-one meeting with Canadian PM Trudeau and that US is not getting along at all with Canadian negotiators, although a Trudeau spokesman later denied he had requested a meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ Cash Rate (Sep) 1.75% vs. Exp. 1.75% (Prev. 1.75%).

Elsewhere, gold eventually shrugged off the post-FOMC volatility and gained but remained below the USD 1200/oz level, while copper underperformed on the back of the indecisive risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Energy Secretary Perry said the US is not considering release from strategic petroleum reserve to lower oil prices because the impact would be small and short-lived. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex was choppy around settlement, given the FOMC&rsquo;s decision to lift rates, and amid the press conference with Chair Powell, who was generally upbeat, but cognizant of risks. Informa points out that ahead of the Fed chair&rsquo;s press conference, Treasuries were bear-steepening, led by the belly, but sellers stepped in with block sales in TYZ8. Choppy trade continued through the end of Powell&rsquo;s presser, which ultimately saw major curve spreads flattening, with 2s10s narrowing beneath its 50DMA, and 2s30s and 5s30s and 5s10s were capped by their 50DMAs. The FOMC rate decision has set the tone for Thursday&rsquo;s 7-year auction, with analysts noting that the recent sell-off of Treasuries has lifted the 7s yield to above 3%, making the WI yield cheaper compared to the previous stop-out rate, which analysts say could provide support. In addition, Societe Generale says that any short-covering from the record net shorts from leveraged funds in the TY futures could also provide support, while the auction may also benefit from month-end extensions. The 7-year has also cheapened on the fly over the last fortnight vs 5s and 10s, which could be a positive. SocGen holds a slightly positive bias going into the auction. US T-note futures (z8) settle&nbsp; 9 ticks higher at 118-23+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he rejected a one-on-one meeting with the Canadian PM and added the US is not getting along at all with Canadian negotiators.

ASX 200 (Unch) was subdued by a pullback in commodity names, while Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) swung between gains and losses at the whim of a choppy currency. Shanghai Comp (-0.4%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) also flip-flopped with the region somewhat cautious as it digested the FOMC and a lock-step hike by the HKMA, while the PBoC skipped open market operations again for a net daily drain of CNY 60bln. Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked US Treasuries higher with prices also supported amid the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement for JPY 880bln in JGBs across the curve before hitting resistance at 150.20.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.1%) is subdued by a pullback in commodity names, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) is kept afloat by a weaker currency. Shanghai Comp (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (+0.2%) are choppy with the region somewhat cautious as it digests the FOMC and a lock-step hike by the HKMA, while the PBoC skipped open market operations again for a net daily drain of CNY 60bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback recovered from post-FOMC losses with DXY printing fresh intraday highs, while EUR/USD is little changed and GBP/USD fell below 1.3150 amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty. NZD/USD initially strengthened after a relatively upbeat RBNZ interest rate decision where the central bank kept rates unchanged but saw early signs of an increase in core inflation and stated that the outlook for OCR assumes growth will pick up over the coming year. However, the gains were short-lived as the RBNZ reiterated that they expect to keep the OCR at the current level into 2020. Elsewhere, USD/CAD reached session highs after US President Trump said he rejected a one-on-one meeting with Canadian PM Trudeau and that US is not getting along at all with Canadian negotiators, although a Trudeau spokesman later denied he had requested a meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs tracked US Treasuries higher with prices also supported amid the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement for JPY 880bln in JGBs across the curve before hitting resistance at 150.20.</p>\r\n",
