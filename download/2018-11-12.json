Also, a PM May spokesperson warned that reports in the FT stating that a Brexit treaty text is almost ready and that the main elements of the text will be presented to the UK cabinet on Tuesday, should be treated with scepticism. Separately, UK PM is struggling to secure a deal on her side, with some now seeing an EU summit being pushed from November to December 13th/14th, and a meaningful vote to January. There were also suggestions that no cabinet agreement could trigger a no-deal Brexit this week. Elsewhere, a spokesman reassured that there are no signs that other ministers are thinking about resigning, adding the Cabinet has backed PM May in moving forward on a Brexit deal, and he expects the Cabinet to continue to do so. Later, reports emerged that senior ministers led by UK Brexit Secretary Raab told PM May that no deal is preferable to the current offer from the EU, Buzzfeed reported, saying current deal would not get through Parliament; Raab told colleagues that no deal is better than current deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s budget resubmission deadline, an official reported that Italian Deputy PM&#39;s Salvini and Di Maio had a &quot;positive&quot; meeting with PM Conte on the budget whilst EU Commission President Juncker said to be &quot;moderately concerned&quot; about Italy&#39;s relation; he added that the country is moving away from the minimum requirements of the stability pact. With regards to economic forecasts, an Italian Parliament watchdog expects Italy&#39;s deficit/GDP to stand at 2.6% in 2019 whilst seeing the 2019 growth target as &quot;increasingly ambitious&quot;; note the Italian government&rsquo;s forecasts a deficit of 2.4% and the EU Commission a deficit of 2.9%. There were also reports suggesting Italy was seeking to lower its budget 2019 growth forecasts to between 1.0%-1.2% from 1.5% to get an EU budget deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> EU President Juncker said the bloc is negotiating with White House officials at all levels to avoid an escalation of trade tensions. In separate news, the US is planning to introduce export controls to fight China intellectual property theft, according to the WSJ. Elsewhere, it was reported that the US Commerce Department was circulating a draft report on auto tariffs with US President Trump set to plan meeting on Tuesday on the auto report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>Fed&#39;s Daly (Voter) said she will not be surprised by a December rate hike and sees at least a couple of hikes in 2019; she believes the Fed should head towards neutral and it is not there yet. She also noted that neutral is uncertain and she does not see it as a stopping point. She stated the Fed&#39;s gradual approach is aimed at a soft landing for the economy. Later she added that the labour market is booming, the US is at or beyond full employment and economic conditions merit gradual normalisation of monetary policy. Finally, she sees inflation rising to a bit above 2% over the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BoE&#39;s Broadbent (Neutral) said there are signs that there will be somewhat weaker UK economic growth in Q4, adding that UK wage growth is materially higher and is now seeing signs of domestic inflation pressure. He clarified that a limited and gradual rate guidance does not mean one rate hike per year precisely, stressing that the important thing is to reassure people that the BoE would not have to engage in very steep series of rate hikes. He noted an intensification of drag on business investment related to Brexit and argued that having or not having a Brexit deal is not definitive in terms of setting interest rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Lautenschlager (Hawk) said she is very much in favour of ending the asset purchase programme and of designing reinvestments in a flexible way and not too long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX 2726% at -1.97%, NDX -2.98% at 6829, DJI -2.32% at 25387. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -2.3%, Materials -1.49%, Industrials -1.98%, Cons Discretionary -2.31%, Cons Staples -0.65%, Healthcare -1.39%, Financials -2.01%, Tech -3.54%, Telecoms -1.48%, Utilities -0.03%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Apple (AAPL) traded lower on reports from one of its suppliers, Lumentum Holdings (LITE), had lowered its guidance due to a large cut in orders from one of its large customers, rumoured to be Apple. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) was a top mover following positive data from its melanoma treating drug. Athenahealth (ATHN) surged on the back of Veritas Capital and Elliot Management acquiring it. The day also gave gains to several utilities such as Dominion Energy (D), American Electric Power (AEP) and Xcel Energy (XEL). Utilities with large exposure to the California wild fires were some of the day&rsquo;s biggest losers, with stocks PG&amp;E (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) both down. Tobacco stocks Altria Group (MO) and Philip Morris (PM) dropped following reports that US regulators are seeking to ban menthol cigarettes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES USD 0.26 LOWER AT USD 59.23/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.06 LOWER AT USD 70.12/BBL. </strong>Crude closed lower for the&nbsp;11th consecutive day after US President Trump stated that &ldquo;oil prices should be much lower based on supply&rdquo; and that he hopes Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting production. Signs that OPEC/non-OPEC partners may reverse policy at its December meeting had previously provided support to the complex earlier on Monday. The weekend JMMC meeting showed an emerging consensus that members are leaning towards production cuts; Saudi Arabia indicated that production may need to be trimmed by as much as 1mln barrels to ensure a balanced market, adding that its own exports in December may fall 500k BPD MoM due to year-end seasonal factors. The Russians, however, were not as pessimistic; energy minister Novak said it was not certain that crude markets would be oversupplied in 2019, and OPEC&#39;s SecGen Barkindo sees an oil market balance in Q4. Separately, the Saudis were said to be surprised that the US had granted waivers to eight nations on Iranian sanctions, Reuters reported citing sources, and some have suggested that the more hawkish rhetoric from may be an attempt to arrest the recent slide in crude prices, after last week both Brent and WTI entered bear-market territory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 8+ TICKS HIGHER AT 118-12+.</strong> Treasury futures were thin, with cash markets closed for Veteran&rsquo;s Day, leaving the complex to trade off broader risk themes. With the risk-off tone begotten by a stronger USD, weighing on equities, and seeing the VIX rise above 20, the mood was defensive, and as such, Treasuries rose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY:</strong> The index remains comfortably above 97.000 and not far from fresh 2018 peaks (97.583), but lost some momentum vs G10 rivals as the likes the Gbp clawed back lost ground, and certain EMs bucked the wider trend of underperformance &ndash; such as the Try (above 5.4500 in wake of improved Turkish current account balance) and Rub (benefiting from the Brent bounce to circa 67.65).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The Pound got a lifeline from the EU amidst ongoing in-fighting and division within UK parliament, as chief negotiator, although underlining that a deal is not yet done. Cable reclaimed the 1.2900 handle, after Barnier stated that the &lsquo;main&rsquo; components of a Brexit withdrawal agreement are ready to be put before the Cabinet on Tuesday, having earlier pared some losses from around 1.2825 as a spox for PM May denied reports that Ministers are ready to resign in protest at the Brexit blueprint presented last week and following a Wednesday deadline set by EU&rsquo;s Tusk in order to allow time for an end of November Summit. Eur/Gbp recoiled from nearly 0.8775 to 0.8710 accordingly, with the single currency suffering from its own specific negative weights (see below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> Not much respite or sign of a last minute coming together between Italy and the EU on the budget front as tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline for Rome to re-submit its fiscal plan fast approaches, as early talk about a meeting to discuss the draft involving PM Conte and Deputies Di Maio and Salvini did not materialise, at least officially. Hence, after tripping mega stops at/around the old ytd base circa 1.1300, selling pressure intensified to sub-1.1250 at one stage, and with only shallow bounces thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CHF:</strong> Both lagging vs the Greenback, with the former unable to rebound far above 0.7200 amidst ongoing US-Chinese trade angst and reports that Washington may deploy export controls in its efforts to thwart IP theft, as the Cnh edged closer towards the 7.0000 level vs the Usd that is deemed to be a line in the sand. Meanwhile, the France struggled at the low end of 1.0105-1.0050 trading parameters but rebounded firmly vs the Eur from 1.1400 and below the big figure during recent sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, JPY, NZD:</strong> Relative outperformers, or at least more resilient than major rivals vs the broadly strong Usd, with the Loonie managing to stay within touching distance of 1.3200 and underpinned by a rebound in crude. The Jpy saw more recovery gains from a 114.20 low towards 113.70 as risk sentiment soured again, while the Kiwi derived independent impetus from favourable cross-winds as Aud/Nzd slipped through 1.0700 and Nzd/Usd hovered around the top of a 0.6705-55 band.</p>\r\n",

Signs that OPEC/non-OPEC partners may reverse policy at its December meeting had previously provided support to the complex earlier on Monday. The weekend JMMC meeting showed an emerging consensus that members are leaning towards production cuts; Saudi Arabia indicated that production may need to be trimmed by as much as 1mln barrels to ensure a balanced market, adding that its own exports in December may fall 500k BPD MoM due to year-end seasonal factors. The Russians, however, were not as pessimistic; energy minister Novak said it was not certain that crude markets would be oversupplied in 2019, and OPEC&#39;s SecGen Barkindo sees an oil market balance in Q4. Separately, the Saudis were said to be surprised that the US had granted waivers to eight nations on Iranian sanctions, Reuters reported citing sources, and some have suggested that the more hawkish rhetoric from may be an attempt to arrest the recent slide in crude prices, after last week both Brent and WTI entered bear-market territory.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As has often been the case of late, the Pound got a lifeline from the EU amidst ongoing in-fighting and division within UK parliament, as chief negotiator Barnier claimed that the &lsquo;main&rsquo; components of a Brexit withdrawal agreement are ready to be put before the Cabinet on Tuesday, although underlining that a deal is not yet done. Cable reclaimed the 1.2900 handle in response having earlier pared some losses from around 1.2825 as a spox for PM May denied reports that Ministers are ready to resign in protest at the Brexit blueprint presented last week, and following a Wednesday deadline set by EU&rsquo;s Tusk in order to allow time for an end of November Summit. Eur/Gbp recoiled from nearly 0.8775 to 0.8710 accordingly, with the single currency suffering from its own specific negative weights (see below).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much respite or sign of a last minute coming together between Italy and the EU on the budget front as tomorrow&rsquo;s deadline for Rome to re-submit its fiscal plan fast approaches, as early talk about a meeting to discuss the draft involving PM Conte and Deputies Di Maio and Salvini did not materialise, at least officially. Moreover, Rome&rsquo;s financial watchdog upped the ante somewhat by predicting a 2.6% 2019 deficit vs the Government&rsquo;s 2.4% assertion and 2.9% from Brussels. Hence, after tripping mega stops at/around the old ytd base circa 1.1300, selling pressure intensified to sub-1.1250 at one stage, and with only shallow bounces thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both lagging vs the Greenback, with the former unable to rebound far above 0.7200 amidst ongoing US-Chinese trade angst and reports that Washington may deploy export controls in its efforts to thwart IP theft, as the Cnh edged closer towards the 7.0000 level vs the Usd that is deemed to be a line in the sand. Meanwhile, the France struggled at the low end of 1.0105-1.0050 trading parameters, but rebounded firmly vs the Eur from 1.1400 and below the big figure during recent sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative outperformers, or at least more resilient than major rivals vs the broadly strong Usd, with the Loonie managing to stay within touching distance of 1.3200 and underpinned by a rebound in crude. The Jpy saw more recovery gains from a 114.20 low towards 113.70 as risk sentiment soured again, while the Kiwi derived independent impetus from favourable cross-winds as Aud/Nzd slipped through 1.0700 and Nzd/Usd hovered around the top of a 0.6705-55 band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index remains comfortably above 97.000 and not far from fresh 2018 peaks (97.583), but lost some momentum vs G10 rivals as the likes the Gbp clawed back lost ground, and certain EMs bucked the wider trend of underperformance &ndash; such as the Try (above 5.4500 in wake of improved Turkish current account balance) and Rub (benefiting from the Brent bounce to circa 67.65).</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) both recovered from the early declines and traded marginally positive although weakness in tech and financials capped gains in Australia, while recent flows into JPY restricted upside for the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) and Hang Seng (+0.1%) were initially lower amid growth and trade-related uncertainty, while the PBoC also recently noted that China&rsquo;s economy is under increasing downward pressure. However, Chinese markets then recovered as officials continued to pledge measures to support businesses including wider tax cuts and with China also upbeat following record-breaking Singles Day sales. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat with price action contained as pressure from the improvement in regional sentiment was counterbalanced by the BoJ presence in the market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

(Independent) As a reminder, Brexit negotiators said on Friday that a draft treaty is close and that both sides were aiming for political approval this week, while separate reports noted that the EU is to require more movement from the UK on Brexit backstop. (FT/Newswires) UK Government source saying that no British cabinet meeting was ever scheduled for today, Brexit negotiations are still ongoing. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top Brexiteers have told UK PM May that they remain deeply opposed to her Chequers plan with sources suggesting negotiators on both sides had agreed it would be impossible for the UK to unilaterally exit its backstop on Northern Ireland.

UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (+0.2%) is outperforming amid currency effects and as several big names are in the green (BHP +2.8%, Shire +2.3%, Anglo American +2.0%) outweighing the significant losses for British American Tobacco (-9.1%) and Imperial Brands (-4.1%) following reports of FDA commissioner pursuing a ban on menthol cigarettes. Similarly, sectors are mixed with IT names lagging and energy names outperforming, with FTSE giant BP (+1.8%) benefiting from the rebound in oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities, Telecom Italia (+4.6%) are leading the Stoxx 600 after reports in Italian press that the Italian government are pushing a fibre deal with the Co. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto (+3.4%) rose to the top of the UK benchmark following the completion of a share-buyback programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar is firmly back in the ascendency, albeit partly due to underperformance in major counterparts due to specific bearish factors. However, the DXY has extended recovery gains beyond 97.000 and through its previous ytd peak to top out just shy of 97.600 at 97.583, with bulls now eyeing relatively strong Fib resistance around 97.871 ahead of 98.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - More Brexit-related weakness in Sterling has tipped Cable through another big figure, and just under 1.2850 at one stage, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded further from recent sub-0.8700 lows towards 0.8775 on latest threats of revolt within the UK Government and time running out fast to reach a withdrawal deal with the EU. From a technical perspective, nearest support in Cable comes in around 1.2810, which coincides with a Fib and decent option expiry interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency is also under considerable pressure, and after triggering stops at 1.1300 vs the Greenback, losses accumulated quickly to 1.1250 where hefty bids stalled further downside for a while. The catalyst, ongoing Italian-EU budget angst ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s deadline for the Government to resubmit a fiscal plan, and another meeting between key Roman officials later today. Note also, 1.1 bn option expiries roll off at the 1.1250 strike, with the same size capping any rebounds to 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD - Both around 0.4-0.45% weaker vs a generally bid Usd, with the France testing 1.1000 and Aud back below 0.7200 amidst renewed weakness in the Yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi is holding up moderately better than its antipodean peer, as Nzd/Usd maintains 0.6700+ status (just) and the Aud/Nzd cross retests support/bids around 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY - Relative outperformers, or at least keeping pace with the Usd as the Loonie pivots 1.3200 and derives underlying support from a rebound in oil prices, while the latter pares losses from circa 114.20 to just above 114.00 due to its greater safe-haven allure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Broad declines in regional currencies vs the resurgent Dollar, but with Usd/Try slipping back from 5.5000+ levels in wake of Turkish current account data revealing another y/y improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+0.4%) and Brent (+1.0%) bounced back with a vengeance as markets had the first opportunity to digest developments from the JMMC meeting during the weekend. The complex was on track for the longest losing streak since 1984, before Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the kingdom plans to reduce oil supply by 500K BPD in December due to a seasonal demand decline. Meanwhile, the JMMC decided not to take decisions on market adjustments on Sunday, with UAE&rsquo;s Energy Minister noting that 2019 will require a change in OPEC strategy, adding that the new strategy is definitely not going to involve hiking output. Furthermore, in early European trade, the Kuwaiti Oil Minister stated that oil exporters discussed some kind of supply cut for next year but no volume was mentioned. Note: weekly API and DoE inventory data have been pushed back by a day due to US Veterans&rsquo; day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.1%) fell to levels last seen in mid-October as the yellow metal tracked USD moves with the DXY reaching new YTD highs in early European trade. Meanwhile, copper is taking a breather from the recent sell-off and nickel extended losses to hit 11-month lows, pressured by concerns of slowing Chinese demand for steel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the weekend JMMC meeting, the committee decided not to take decisions on market adjustment, while Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Al-Falih said it is too premature for OPEC to discuss production cuts but stated that Saudi will reduce oil supply by 500k bpd in December amid seasonal decline in demand. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Energy Minister Al Falih says that they need to cut 1mln BPD from the Oct. level; adding that he cannot promise that there is no consideration of disbanding OPEC. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian average daily oil production stood at 11.39mln barrels between November 1st to 11th. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Foreign Minister Hunt is to meet the Saudi Crown Prince in regard to the killing of Journalist Khashoggi. This comes after Turkish President Erdogan said he gave Britain, US, France, Germany and Saudi access to the audio recording of the journalist&rsquo;s killing. (Times/Washington Post)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pace has slowed somewhat further, but Bunds and Gilts have both extended gains to marginal new highs on Eurex and Liffe, at 160.39 and 122.47 respectively (+36 and +65 ticks on the day) amidst ongoing/heightened Brexit and Italian budget anxiety, which have taken their toll of BTPs, the Gbp and Eur along with wider risk sentiment. Note, the 10 year Italian bond is back below 122.00 and close to a 121.85 base vs 122.59 at one stage, while US Treasuries have also latched on to the safe-haven bid in EU benchmarks with the curve faller again, albeit volumes crimped by Veterans Day.&nbsp;Back to Bunds, and technically speaking 160.56-58 looms next in terms of upside objectives.</p>\r\n",

UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 (+0.4%) is outperforming amid currency effects and as several big names are in the green (BHP +2.8%, Shire +2.3%, Anglo American +2.0%) outweighing the significant losses for British American Tobacco (-8.1%) and Imperial Brands (-3.8%) following reports of FDA commissioner pursuing a ban on menthol cigarettes. Similarly, sectors are mixed with IT names lagging and energy names outperforming, with FTSE giant BP (+1.8%) benefiting from the rebound in oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of individual equities, Telecom Italia (+5.3%) are leading the Stoxx 600 after reports in Italian press that the Italian government are pushing a fibre deal with the Co. Elsewhere, Rio Tinto (+3.5%) rose to the top of the UK benchmark following the completion of a share-buyback programme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - The Dollar is firmly back in the ascendency, albeit partly due to underperformance in major counterparts due to specific bearish factors. However, the DXY has extended recovery gains beyond 97.000 and through its previous ytd peak to top out just shy of 97.600 at 97.583, with bulls now eyeing relatively strong Fib resistance around 97.871 ahead of 98.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - More Brexit-related weakness in Sterling has tipped Cable through another big figure, and just under 1.2850 at one stage, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded further from recent sub-0.8700 lows towards 0.8775 on latest threats of revolt within the UK Government and time running out fast to reach a withdrawal deal with the EU. From a technical perspective, nearest support in Cable comes in around 1.2810, which coincides with a Fib and decent option expiry interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency is also under considerable pressure, and after triggering stops at 1.1300 vs the Greenback, losses accumulated quickly to 1.1250 where hefty bids stalled further downside for a while. The catalyst, ongoing Italian-EU budget angst ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s deadline for the Government to resubmit a fiscal plan, and another meeting between key Roman officials later today. Note also, 1.1 bn option expiries roll off at the 1.1250 strike, with the same size capping any rebounds to 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD - Both around 0.4-0.45% weaker vs a generally bid Usd, with the France testing 1.1000 and Aud back below 0.7200 amidst renewed weakness in the Yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The Kiwi is holding up moderately better than its antipodean peer, as Nzd/Usd maintains 0.6700+ status (just) and the Aud/Nzd cross retests support/bids around 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY - Relative outperformers, or at least keeping pace with the Usd as the Loonie pivots 1.3200 and derives underlying support from a rebound in oil prices, while the latter pares losses from circa 114.20 to just above 114.00 due to its greater safe-haven allure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Broad declines in regional currencies vs the resurgent Dollar, but with Usd/Try slipping back from 5.5000+ levels in wake of Turkish current account data revealing another y/y improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pace has slowed somewhat further, but Bunds and Gilts have both extended gains to marginal new highs on Eurex and Liffe, at 160.39 and 122.47 respectively (+36 and +65 ticks on the day) amidst ongoing/heightened Brexit and Italian budget anxiety, which have taken their toll of BTPs, the Gbp and Eur along with wider risk sentiment. Note, the 10 year Italian bond is back below 122.00 and close to a 121.85 base vs 122.59 at one stage, while US Treasuries have also latched on to the safe-haven bid in EU benchmarks with the curve faller again, albeit volumes crimped by Veterans Day.&nbsp;Back to Bunds, and technically speaking 160.56-58 looms next in terms of upside objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+0.4%) and Brent (+1.0%) bounced back with a vengeance as markets had the first opportunity to digest developments from the JMMC meeting during the weekend. The complex was on track for the longest losing streak since 1984, before Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih said the kingdom plans to reduce oil supply by 500K BPD in December due to a seasonal demand decline. Meanwhile, the JMMC decided not to take decisions on market adjustments on Sunday, with UAE&rsquo;s Energy Minister noting that 2019 will require a change in OPEC strategy, adding that the new strategy is definitely not going to involve hiking output. Furthermore, in early European trade, the Kuwaiti Oil Minister stated that oil exporters discussed some kind of supply cut for next year but no volume was mentioned. Note: weekly API and DoE inventory data have been pushed back by a day due to US Veterans&rsquo; day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold (-0.2%) fell to levels last seen in mid-October as the yellow metal tracked USD moves with the DXY reaching new YTD highs in early European trade. Meanwhile, copper is taking a breather from the recent sell-off and nickel extended losses to hit 11-month lows, pressured by concerns of slowing Chinese demand for steel.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar is firmly back in the ascendency, albeit partly due to underperformance in major counterparts due to specific bearish factors. However, the DXY has extended recovery gains beyond 97.000 and through its previous ytd peak to top out just shy of 97.600 at 97.583, with bulls now eyeing relatively strong Fib resistance around 97.871 ahead of 98.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More Brexit-related weakness in Sterling has tipped Cable through another big figure, and just under 1.2850 at one stage, while Eur/Gbp has rebounded further from recent sub-0.8700 lows towards 0.8775 on latest threats of revolt within the UK Government and time running out fast to reach a withdrawal deal with the EU. From a technical perspective, nearest support in Cable comes in around 1.2810, which coincides with a Fib and decent option expiry interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency is also under considerable pressure, and after triggering stops at 1.1300 vs the Greenback, losses accumulated quickly to 1.1250 where hefty bids stalled further downside for a while. The catalyst, ongoing Italian-EU budget angst ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s deadline for the Government to resubmit a fiscal plan, and another meeting between key Roman officials later today. Note also, 1.1 bn option expiries roll off at the 1.1250 strike, with the same size capping any rebounds to 1.1300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.4-0.45% weaker vs a generally bid Usd, with the France testing 1.1000 and Aud back below 0.7200 amidst renewed weakness in the Yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi is holding up moderately better than its antipodean peer, as Nzd/Usd maintains 0.6700+ status (just) and the Aud/Nzd cross retests support/bids around 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative outperformers, or at least keeping pace with the Usd as the Loonie pivots 1.3200 and derives underlying support from a rebound in oil prices, while the latter pares losses from circa 114.20 to just above 114.00 due to its greater safe-haven allure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broad declines in regional currencies vs the resurgent Dollar, but with Usd/Try slipping back from 5.5000+ levels in wake of Turkish current account data revealing another y/y improvement.</p>\r\n",

The initial weakness came amidst early strength in BTPs and reports that the Italian Government may be looking to shave its 2019 GDP forecast, although it&rsquo;s the deficit and debt reduction assumptions that are really at odds with EU calculations, just a day before the latest deadline to re-submit a draft budget. In the interim, another data snapshot from Italy in the form of ip data for September that is forecast to be downbeat.</p>\r\n",

(CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House Democrats are to probe US President Trump&rsquo;s role regarding hush payments in 2016, while there were also reports that Federal prosecutors have gathered evidence that US President Trump participated in hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal which would violate campaign laws. (WSJ) in related news, US House Democrats are to probe US President Trump for targeting CNN and Washington Post, while they are also expected to probe Trump&rsquo;s actions related to Amazon and AT&amp;T.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) both recovered from the early declines and traded marginally positive although weakness in tech and financials capped gains in Australia, while recent flows into JPY restricted upside for the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.8%) and Hang Seng (+0.1%) were initially lower amid growth and trade-related uncertainty, while the PBoC also recently noted that China&rsquo;s economy is under increasing downward pressure. However, Chinese markets then recovered as officials continued to pledge measures to support businesses including wider tax cuts and with China also upbeat following record-breaking Singles Day sales. Finally, 10yr JGBs were relatively flat with price action contained as pressure from the improvement in regional sentiment was counterbalanced by the BoJ presence in the market.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade indecisive but off worst levels after having shrugged-off most the opening losses and the weak performance on Wall St last Friday, where ongoing global growth concerns and continued weakness in commodities weighed on sentiment. ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) both recovered from the early declines to trade marginally positive but with weakness in tech and financials capping gains in Australia, while recent flows into JPY limited upside for the Japanese benchmark. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.2%) are choppy amid growth and trade-related uncertainty, while the PBoC recently noted that China&rsquo;s economy is under increasing downward pressure and officials have continued to pledge measures to support businesses including wider tax cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD holds on to recent gains and tests the 97.00 level to the upside as its major counterparts struggle with EUR/USD at the weaker end of the 1.1300 handle, while GBP/USD gapped lower towards the 1.2900 level after reports that UK PM May cancelled an emergency cabinet meeting due to strong opposition regarding her Brexit plans which severely lessens the likelihood of an EU summit later this month. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies have nursed Friday&rsquo;s losses as they find solace from early strength in oil prices after Saudi announced to reduce its exports by 500k bpd next month, while JPY-crosses are slightly higher amid the somewhat improved risk sentiment but still have far to got to get back to last week&rsquo;s highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat with price action contained as pressure from the slight improvement in regional sentiment is counterbalanced by the BoJ presence in the market for a reserved JPY 475bln of JGBs.</p>\r\n",
