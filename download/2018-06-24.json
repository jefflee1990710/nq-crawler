(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey President Erdogan declared himself the winner of the Presidential election with 53% of the vote which if confirmed would avoid a 2nd round runoff, although the opposition have not yet conceded and believe the results are incomplete and may still be heading to a 2nd round. (Newswires<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC agreed to raise output on Friday although the Communique did not specify size of supply production increase, while OPEC sources initially said the latest agreement will amount, in practice, to an increase supply of between 400k-600k BPD. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Al Falih stated that it was a 1mln BPD production increase and that OPEC+ members will try to restore compliance to 100%, while Saudi Arabia also announced it will increase production. Furthermore, Al-Falih also commented that the total OPEC+ oil hike is closer to 1mln bpd than 600k and that it would be a concern if Friday&rsquo;s increase in prices were to become a trend. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iraqi Oil Minister said the real output increase is between 700-800k BPD and will test the market until September, while he added that any country that has excess compliance will have to return to 100%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted that he hopes OPEC will increase output substantially and that they need to keep prices down. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baker Hughes Rig Count (22 June) total rigs -7 to 1052, with oil rigs down by 1 to 862 which is the 1st reduction of oil rigs in 12 weeks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US/NORTH AMERICA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canada&rsquo;s NAFTA negotiator Verheul said on Friday that there were no active NAFTA talks at that moment. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russia&#39;s Economy Minister Oreshkin said Russia will increase tariffs on US autos. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian CPI Inflation YY (May) 2.2% vs. Exp. 2.5% (Prev. 2.2%). (Newswires)<br />Canadian Retail Sales MM (Apr) -1.2% vs. Exp. 0.0% (Prev. 0.6%, Rev. 0.8%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US equity futures had a relatively quiet day; the Emini grinded higher overnight, but at the Wall St. open it fell ~10points in the first hour, before losses were erased as the day progressed. The Energy sector led the way on Friday trade, tracking higher oil prices after the OPEC meeting while Financials underperformed as well as the tech sector which was hampered by RedHat due to a poor earnings report, where its guidance was lower than Wall St expectations, seeing the stock trade lower by as much as 15%, despite beating its numbers on both top and bottom line. The poor outlook spilt over into some other software names such as Splunk (SPLK), Microsoft (MSFT) and VM Ware (VMW). Noteworthy for US auto names (but more so European ones), President Trump threatened a 20% tariff on EU autos imported into the US if trade barriers and tariffs were not lowered or removed. In an immediate reaction auto names spiked lower in both regions, however some of the losses were pared back and GM and FCAU closed higher, but F and HOG remained in the red. SPX +0.2% at 2754, NASDAQ 100 -0.3% at 7197, DJI +0.5% at 24581.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were flat on Friday, and volume was thin, though the complex does close higher for the second straight week, ahead of next week, where the US Treasury will auction more than $200bln of paper. Higher stocks initially had Treasuries on the back foot on Friday, and yields were also dancing to the tune of oil prices. But losses were pared as we headed into the close, with the curve steepening a touch on the day. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) 1 tick lower at 119-26+.</p>\r\n",
