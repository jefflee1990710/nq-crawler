As wall street opened, the 200dma was tested multiple times before breaching under the pressure and subsequently extending to lows to slightly below the 2600 support, but then rebound back to pre-market levels around 2630. Stock specifics were very much based on earnings yet again: Marathon Oil (MRO), NRG Energy (NRG) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) were some of the outperformers in the SPX today. Cardinal Health (CAH) was the largest underperformer on Thursday following its earnings report in which it lowered its FY18 Adj. EPS guidance, where shares fell, printing losses of 20%, which pressured the SPX to be the underperformer of the three US indices. The NDX was hampered by earnings from Tesla (TSLA) which beat expectations, however, the electric vehicle maker ended the quarter reporting a record loss of USD 784.6mln. Over in the DJI, Nike (NKE) was the underperformer after taking a hit following competitor Adidas&rsquo; (ADS GY) earnings, which were hit after a decline in the reebok brand of 3% following a reduced demand for running and training categories and also in the earnings call it was noted the world cup in Russia is offering less financial opportunities than the last world cup. M&amp;A News today was relatively light, in hours sources reported Vodafone (VOD LN) were looking to acquire Liberty Global&rsquo;s (LBTYA) European assets. Elsewhere, a Dealreporter suggested Microsemi (MSCC) and Microchip (MCHP) are to win regulatory approval in China for the merger between the two. SPX -0.23% at 2630, NDX -0.02% at 6643, DJI +0.02%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries closed slightly higher for the session, with action choppy (taking its cue from choppy trade in the equity complex) but within contained ranges ahead of NFP day tomorrow. Action was indecisive ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data, and the AHE data will likely provide the next catalyst for the TPLEX. Most of the buying action was concentrated in the belly and front end of the curve as 2yr and 5yr yields were lower by c.2bps. 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c. 2bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 5+ ticks higher at 119-11.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 3 May 2018: ISM Miss, NFP eyed and geopolitical tensions continue to bubble ",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: </strong>Equities flat, Treasuries higher , DXY flat , Crude higher.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW:</strong> Non-MFG ISM, EZ CPI Flash miss, Norges Bank keep rates on hold<br /><strong>* AHEAD: </strong>After-market earnings; EOG, ED, Fri earnings: BABA, CELG, BASF GY, BMW GY, AIR FP, US Jobs report, EU Markit PMIs, Fed and ECB speak, US/China press conference</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHINA TRADE: </strong>US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross and NEC Director Kudlow refused to comment after a dinner meeting in Beijing with Chinese policymakers, where trade imbalances were discussed; Reports from the WSJ said that US and China negotiators see the current Beijing round as the first of many rounds of talks. VP Pence&rsquo;s economic advisor Calabria said first day of talks with China have been positive, and the US delegation will ask China to lower tariffs to match US levels and reported Trump wants to see a free trade deal with Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*NAFTA: </strong>Economic Advisor Calabria also said US President Trump is optimistic on a tentative NAFTA deal before June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Iran&#39;s foreign minister Zarif said Iran will not renegotiate or accept a ratification of the nuclear deal, adding the US has repeatedly violated the agreement.<strong> </strong>Elsewhere, the overnight sources story which suggested Trump is edging towards pulling out of the Iran nuclear accord continued to feature in traders discussions through Thursday, ahead of the 12/May decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*NORGES BANK:</strong> Norges Bank kept interest rates unchanged at 0.50%, as expected. The central bank said, &ldquo;the outlook and the balance of risks do not appear to have changed substantially since the March report.&rdquo; It acknowledged the softer inflation and growth developments among trading partners but did see positive effects from higher oil prices. As such, its policy rate will be raised after summer 2018, in line with its previous guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*DATA: </strong>The <strong>ISM non-manufacturing</strong> index fell short of expectations in April at 56.8 vs. a consensus 58.8. The softer index was not much of a surprise following the boost in retail sales seen last autumn, though it remains broadly in line with its 2017 average level. Nonetheless, Pantheon Macroeconomics noted that the ISM non-manufacturing employment index represents more of a worry ahead of Friday&rsquo;s Employment Situation Report, since it fell more than 3 points to a 12-month low, and pointing towards payroll growth around 125k. On the other hand, weekly <strong>jobless claims</strong> saw an unexpected fall this week (211k vs. exp. 225k) mostly attributed to seasonal factors. Claims are expected to pick up next week, yet the trend is likely to remain low, analysts said. The US <strong>international trade</strong> deficit fell to USD 49bln, a touch below expectations of USD 50bln, dictated by a sharp fall in Q1 imports. Imports are anticipated to decline further, making trade a remarkable supporter of GDP growth. In Europe, focus was on the <strong>Eurozone flash CPI</strong> data for<strong> </strong>April,<strong> </strong>which<strong> </strong>unexpectedly fell to 1.2% from 1.3% amid temporary Easter timing effect as the event came earlier compared to April 2017. The mild rise in food and energy prices was offset by a sharp drop in the core measure which fell to 0.7% from 0.9%. Underlying price pressure remains subdued and until there are no signs of inflation building up in the Eurozone, the ECB will remain cautious on monetary policy normalisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB SPEAK: ECB&#39;s Praet (Dovish) </strong>iterated a parallel narrative to the statement made by ECB&rsquo;s Draghi last week. He noted that data points towards a moderation to the Euro area economy and argued substantial progress has been made on the path towards a sustained adjustment in inflation, though ample degree of monetary stimulus is still necessary as price pressure developments remain subdued.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES: SPX -0.23% at 2630, NDX -0.02% at 6643, DJI +0.02% at 23930 SECTORS:</strong> Cons Cyclicals: =-0.54%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.70%, Energy: -0.44%, Financials: -0.82%, Health Care: -0.68%, Industrials: +0.26%, Materials: +0.33%, Technology: +0.20%, Telecoms: -0.63%, Utilities: -0.07%. US Equity futures traded lower before the US cash open as a risk off tone eased into the markets, which was then escalated following reports of a large block bond buyer in 10yr and ultra USTs. As wall street opened, the 200dma was tested multiple times before breaching under the pressure and subsequently extending to lows to slightly below the 2600 support, but then rebound back to pre-market levels around 2630. Stock specifics were very much based on earnings yet again: Marathon Oil (MRO), NRG Energy (NRG) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) were some of the outperformers in the <strong>SPX</strong> today. Cardinal Health (CAH) was the largest underperformer on Thursday following its earnings report in which it lowered its FY18 Adj. EPS guidance, where shares fell, printing losses of 20%, which pressured the SPX to be the underperformer of the three US indices. The <strong>NDX</strong> was hampered by earnings from Tesla (TSLA) which beat expectations, however, the electric vehicle maker ended the quarter reporting a record loss of USD 784.6mln. Over in the <strong>DJI</strong>, Nike (NKE) was the underperformer after taking a hit following competitor Adidas&rsquo; (ADS GY) earnings, which were hit after a decline in the reebok brand of 3% following a reduced demand for running and training categories and also in the earnings call it was noted the world cup in Russia is offering less financial opportunities than the last world cup. M&amp;A News today was relatively light, in hours sources reported Vodafone (VOD LN) were looking to acquire Liberty Global&rsquo;s (LBTYA) European assets. Elsewhere, a Dealreporter suggested Microsemi (MSCC) and Microchip (MCHP) are to win regulatory approval in China for the merger between the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI settles $0.50 higher at $68.43/bbl; Brent settles $0.26 higher at $13.62/bbl. </strong>Oil prices picked up in afternoon trade on Thursday, as the general risk tone improved, aided by geopolitical tensions after Iran&nbsp; warned that its nuclear deal will not be renegotiated; however, crude did pare gains in pre-settlement trade. Oil continues to take its cue from geopolitical developments, as evidenced by oil prices shrugging-off inventory builds this week &ndash; overnight news that Trump is edging towards pulling out of the nuclear accord and reapplying sanctions on Iran featured heavily in traders minds. Other specific fundamental news flow was thin on Thursday: Russian energy minister Novak again said Russia is fully committed to bringing balance to the oil market China&rsquo;s Sinopec is set to cut loadings of Saudi crude in June for the second straight month, due to high prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong><strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 5+ ticks higher at 119-11. </strong>Treasuries closed slightly higher for the session, with action choppy (taking its cue from choppy trade in the equity complex) but within contained ranges ahead of NFP day tomorrow. Action was indecisive ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data, and the AHE data will likely provide the next catalyst for the TPLEX. Most of the buying action was concentrated in the belly and front end of the curve as 2yr and 5yr yields were lower by c.2bps. 2s30s and 5s30s narrowed by c. 2bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>USD</strong>: The DXY marginally extended its post-FOMC retreat to just under 92.400 before regaining some traction from US data (claims, trade, final services PMI and factory orders trumping sub-forecast productivity, labour costs and non-manufacturing ISM), and once again by virtue of weakness in several currency counterparts. Trade remained choppy overall with the Greenback and markets in general still mulling the policy implications of the Fed&rsquo;s new symmetrical approach to inflation targeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CHF, JPY: </strong>Marked divergence between the 2 traditional safe-havens, with USDCHF &nbsp;revisiting peaks around parity and perhaps banking on more Franc still too strong verbal intervention from SNB&rsquo;s Jordan later today. Conversely, a bout of risk-off trade (S&amp;P and Dow sub-200 DMAs) pulled USDJPY back further from 110.00 towards 109.00 amidst wider JPY buying in cross pairings and the absence of Japanese participants due Constitution Day (and for the record the centre is also closed on Friday for Greenery Day).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>The Kiwi has managed to catch and fly past its antipodean peer as the AUDNZD cross dips back under the recent 1.0700 pivot and a mega (1.1 bn) AUDUSD option expiry at 0.7500 weighed into and around the NY cut. NZDAUD around 0.7030.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>In stark contrast to its US counterpart, the Loonie was undermined by trade data showing the widest gap on record as NAFTA negotiations and import tariff uncertainty rumbles on &ndash; USDCAD- back towards the upper end of a 1.2890-15 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>Sub-forecast EZ inflation and UK services PMI still weighing on the EUR and GBP, with the former unable to seriously recover and retest 1.2000 vs the USD and Cable capped around 1.3600. However, big option expiries also influenced EURUSD with 3.6 bn spanning 1.1950-1.2000, while the Pound found some underlying support ahead of layered corporate bids between 1.3555-1.3520.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SEK, NOK: </strong>Both Scandis ending the session on the up vs the Eur after Riksbank and Norges Bank guidance indicating hikes before the ECB is likely to tighten &ndash; EURSEK sub-10.6000 and EURNOK under 9.6400 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19104/download\" style=\"color:blue; text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Non-Farm Payrolls</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; The BLS will release April&rsquo;s Employment Situation Report at 1330BST/0830EDT on 4th May 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Unemployment rate expected to drop to lowest since 2000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Average hourly earnings key for future of Fed policy</p>\r\n",

Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.9%) was the regional outperformer and gained across all sectors with miners underpinned amid upside in metals, while NAB was among the laggards after a decline in H1 cash profit. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) and Hang Seng (-1.7%) declined after a daily net liquidity drain by the PBoC and amid trade concerns ahead of talks between US and China, with tech and telecoms related stocks pressured after reports the US is considering equipment sales restrictions on Chinese telecom firms over national security concerns. As a reminder, Japan is shut for the remainder of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to be considering equipment sales restrictions on Chinese telecom firms over national security concerns. In related news, a Chinese trade official commented that China will not accept pre-conditions in trade discussions and that China is more prepared than the US to cope with a trade war. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 70bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3732 (Prev. 6.3670).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May reportedly told a minister the UK will leave the Customs Union, while reports also noted that she acknowledged the customs partnership plan was unfeasible after strong opposition by cabinet ministers. (Telegraph/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU CPI Flash YY (Apr) 1.2% vs. Exp. 1.3% (Prev. 1.3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Services PMI (Apr) 52.8 vs. Exp. 53.5 (Prev. 51.7)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norges Bank Interest Rate Decision 0.50% vs. Exp. 0.50% (Prev. 0.50%). Comments stated that outlook and balance of risks have not changed substantially, inflation is below target, as such policy rate will be raised after summer 2018. Krone is weaker than expected as measured by the import weighted exchange rate. There was little new information about growth in the Norwegian economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&#39;s Jansson says that there is a limit for how expansionary policy can be, but haven&#39;t reached there yet, hopes next step will be tightening of policy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&#39;s Skingsley not at the point where rate hikes can begin. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank Governor Ingves says the rate path is a forecast, not a promise. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reportedly has all but decided to end nuclear agreement with Iran, according to sources which added it is unclear how he will withdraw from the agreement. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities opened on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.2%) as US-Sino trade talks start in Beijing. Major bourses are lower on the day whilst Switzerland&rsquo;s SMI 20 outperforms its peers. Most sectors are in the red with the exception of energy and IT. Logitech (+7.0%) shares soared following earnings, buoying the IT sector along with it. Glencore (+1.1%) is at the top of the FTSE following pleasing production numbers. Other individual movers post-earnings include: Veolia (+2.5%), Gerberit (+3.1%), Infineon (+0.9%), Vonovia (-1.4%) and Smith &amp; Nephew (-6.0%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very choppy trade in the FOMC aftermath, but ultimately the index has pulled back from fresh 2018 highs around 92.830 made in the run-up to circa 92.500. To recap, the Fed&rsquo;s latest assessment acknowledged inflation rising to within a whisker of its target rate, but was less upbeat on the pace of economic activity and unexpectedly added a degree of flexibility around the 2% price mandate, which has been perceived dovishly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vying for pole position among the G10 community, as the antipodean Dollars continue to reap the most or bear the brunt of their US peer&rsquo;s changing fortunes. Both have reclaimed psychological levels vs the Usd above 0.7500 and 0.7000 respectively, but with the Aud just shading the Kiwi for bragging rights down under after a much bigger than forecast trade surplus overnight &ndash; cross back above 1.0700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another beneficiary of the broad Greenback downturn amidst rebounding oil prices and looking ahead to Canadian trade data that is expected to reveal a narrower deficit. Usd/Cad is back down in the low 1.2800 area and eyeing residual bids from 1.2820-00 that were not quite filled recently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both movers on independent factors, as Eur/Usd revisited sub-1.1950 lows on the back of weaker than consensus Eurozone CPI and Cable retreated from 1.3600+ again in wake of the UK services PMI miss that has dragged BoE hike expectations for next week down to single digits from almost odd-on this time last month. Tech supports eyed in Eur/Usd still the major 1.1936 Fib and for Cable 1.3550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively large corrections from arguably even bigger market levels after Usd/Jpy touched 110.00 and Usd/Chf shaved parity &ndash; headline pairs now around 109.50 and 0.9960 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOK/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrasting fortunes for the 2 Scandi Crowns as the Nok is underpinned by the Norges Bank reaffirming intentions to hike &lsquo;after Summer&rsquo; this year, but the Riksbank reiterates no tightening until the end of 2018. However, Eur/Nok and Eur/Sek are both softer on a weaker single currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have both rebounded sharply on downbeat/bullish fundamentals in the form of sub-forecast and even further away from ECB target EZ inflation, and a UK services PMI miss that had virtually wiped out the remaining slim prospect of a BoE hike next Thursday. The core 10 year debt futures are just off new Eurozone and Liffe peaks of 158.87 and 122.26, +28 and +35 ticks on the day vs -16 and -21 ticks at one stage. Meanwhile, US Treasuries have climbed off overnight lows in tandem, but not in sync as the Fed flagged further policy normalisation, albeit not quite victory on the inflation mandate. Note also, USTs are looking ahead to a raft of data later, not to mention the key monthly BLS report tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices have recovered from yesterday&#39;s post-DoE sell off with prices continuing to factor in the risks surrounding Iranian-US relations with the latest source reports suggesting that US President Trump is reportedly all but decided to end the nuclear agreement with Iran. In other energy newsflow, China&#39;s Sinopec is planning to cut Saudi crude oil loadings by 40% in June for a 2nd month on high prices; according to a UNIPEC official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, spot gold is sitting in modest positive territory following yesterday&#39;s FOMC release and a slightly softer USD. Elsewhere, aluminium prices have risen for the second consecutive session, as attention turns to developments on US-China trade talks being conducted today. Copper was flat overnight with trade contained amid opposing forces of rising metal prices in China during early trade and a broad risk averse tone.</p>\r\n",

In other energy newsflow,&nbsp;China&#39;s Sinopec is planning to cut Saudi crude oil loadings by 40% in June for a 2nd month on high prices; according to a UNIPEC official.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, spot gold is sitting in modest positive territory following yesterday&#39;s FOMC release and a slightly softer USD. Elsewhere, aluminium prices have risen for the second consecutive session, as attention turns to developments on US-China trade talks being conducted today. Copper was flat overnight with trade contained amid opposing forces of rising metal prices in China during early trade and a broad risk averse tone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Prior to that, the premier services PMI is due and the headline print is expected to improve to 53.5 from 51.7 previously.

The 10 year German benchmark opened at 158.65 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 158.59 close, but immediately hit offers to trade back down to 158.43 before finding (relatively light and tentative) underlying bids. Looking ahead, flash Eurozone CPI forms the spotlight regional data release, but there is heavy supply to absorb from France and Spain plus several ECB speakers all before a packed US docket, and of course NFP on Friday. From a technical standpoint, market contacts note that rising trend-line support was breached around 158.58 and a downside target area from 158.46-44 may offer some support, but a clean break could expose 158.38 before 158.28.</p>\r\n",

The package for May was $73bln (versus $66bln previously).

The Treasury will also raise the auction sizes by $1bln for each of the next 5-, 7-, and 10-year notes and the 30-year bond auctions in May. It also intends to introduce a new 2-month bill later this calendar year, and is evaluating whether to add a second new 5-year TIPS security to the annual TIPS calendar.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mostly negative following the weakness on Wall St. where pressure was seen post-FOMC with the Fed seen to remain firmly on track for a June hike. As a reminder, the Fed kept rates unchanged at 1.50%-1.75% as expected and although there was some indecision due to the language tweaks in the statement, it did little to derail the consensus for a second hike this year at the next meeting. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (+0.9%) is the regional outperformer and has seen gains across all sectors with miners strengthening amid upside in metals, while NAB is among the laggards after a decline in H1 cash profit. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) and Hang Seng (-1.9%) are negative after a daily net liquidity drain by the PBoC and amid trade concerns ahead of talks between US and China, with underperformance seen in tech and telecoms related stocks after reports the US is considering equipment sales restrictions on Chinese telecom firms over national security concerns. As a reminder, Japan is shut for the remainder of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback has somewhat been on a roller-coaster ride in the wake of the FOMC with an initial dovish reaction seen after the Fed stated that inflation has moved close to its &ldquo;symmetric&rdquo; inflation target of 2%, which was eventually interpreted as the idea that the Fed would be prepared to allow an overshoot of inflation. However, the weakness in the greenback was then sharply reversed as markets digested the Fed&rsquo;s reference to inflation having moved close to 2% vs. Prev. rhetoric that inflation continued to run below 2%, while trade since then has mainly consisted of the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts nursing losses. Elsewhere, antipodeans are also attempting a rebound with AUD/USD underpinned by a larger than expected trade surplus, while NZD/USD just about reclaimed the 0.7000 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk513086319\"></a></p>\r\n",
