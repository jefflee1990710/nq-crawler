Furthermore, Kataoka also opposed the assessment of CPI and stated there is&nbsp;a small chance of prices gathering pace towards the 2% target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s release is not expected to have a significant effect on Japanese asset classes considering that the decision failed to impact markets, while there was also a more recent meeting earlier this week in which the BoJ also kept policy unchanged as expected and maintained all Real GDP and Core CPI forecasts in the Outlook Report.</p>\r\n",

However, Draghi then stressed that current data does not point towards a deposit rate hike in 2018, and reiterated previous comments on ECB policy sequencing.

However, Draghi did reveal that several members of the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council did express concerns with regards to a possible change in US policy, noting that there is additional concern about unwarranted tightening of monetary policy. Later in the day the latest ECB sources story suggested that rate setters are split about the next move as the Euro&rsquo;s rise complicates the outlook.

        "content": "<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.06% at 2839, DJI +0.54% at 26393, NDX -0.04% at 6916</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dow pushed higher at the opening bell, benefitting from 3M&rsquo;s (MMM) and Caterpillar&rsquo;s (CAT) earnings, although CAT moved into negative territory later in the day. The Dow was also supported by Boeing (BA), who benefitted from Bombardier trade dispute headlines which led to the index outperforming both the S&amp;P &amp; Nasdaq 100 as energy sector weighed. Markets await Intel (INTC), Starbucks (SBUX) and Western Digital (WDC) earnings after hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Top sectors: Utilities +1.53%, Healthcare +0.89%, Telecom/Materials +0.71%<br />Bottom sectors: Energy -0.77%, IT -0.24%, Financials -0.19%</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504676370\"><strong>TREASURIES: US T-Note Futures settled 7+ ticks higher at 122-14</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries took a hit in the early part of the ECB press conference as Draghi sounded relatively upbeat and didn&rsquo;t push back against the recent bout of Euro strength, and was also aided by sell side flow in Bunds. However, Draghi then stressed that current data does not point towards a deposit rate hike in 2018, and reiterated previous comments on ECB policy sequencing. This helped put a bid back in to fixed income, before a stellar US 7-year note auction (although some sources suggest that the >1bps stop through came via one aggressive bid).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.1% heading into APAC trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greenback unwound its earlier losses as US President Donald Trump said that Treasury Secretary Mnuchin&#39;s comments were taken out of context and that the US administration ultimately wants to see a stronger USD. This propelled the dollar to fresh session highs against the majority of its major counterparts in late dealing as the DXY moved into positive territory, although the USD did close off of best levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB President Mario Draghi abstained from pushing back against the recent bout of Euro strength following the ECB&rsquo;s latest monetary policy decision, with the EURUSD registering highs of 1.2536. However, Draghi did reveal that several members of the ECB&rsquo;s Governing Council did express concerns with regards to a possible change in US policy, noting that there is additional concern about unwarranted tightening of monetary policy. Later in the day the latest ECB sources story suggested that rate setters are split about the next move as the Euro&rsquo;s rise complicates the outlook. The piece went to note that some want to remove the easing bias about ramping up QE if needed in March, others are more cautious, and want a full reassessment at the next meeting, while some ECB officials are said to prefer June for a next policy shift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBPUSD ran out of steam just below 1.4350 after pushing higher as UK Chancellor Hammond stated that he is happy at where the GBP is currently trading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USDCHF ran below 0.9300 as USDJPY hovered above the touted key &lsquo;support&rsquo; level of 108.50 before Trump&rsquo;s comments reversed the moves, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES: WTI crude futures settled at USD 65.51/bbl, down USD 0.10, Brent crude futures settled at USD 70.42/bbl, down USD 0.11</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude traded in a contained manner for most of the session after OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said that OPEC and Non-OPEC cooperation will go on beyond market re-balancing, adding that other nations are welcome to join the pact. Ultimately the stronger dollar led to crude futures settling in negative territory, moving lower in post-settlement dealing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold also moved lower as the greenback moved to highs finishing the day a little over USD 10/oz lower in spot trade.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>As broadly expected, there were no policy announcements at the January policy meeting and the monetary policy statement remained unchanged. FX volatility is a concern for the GC and represents a downside risk to the macroeconomic outlook, but upside risks related to the momentum of the cyclical expansion were also stressed. Although President Draghi emphasised the forward guidance on rates, and in particular the reference to &ldquo;well past the end of net asset purchases&rdquo;, we still believe that under our forecast of a 2.5% growth rate&nbsp;this year and some progress on inflation, the ECB will end its APP in September and proceed with a first depo rate hike in December.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Draghi delivered a very bullish view of euro area growth, even if inflation remains uninspiring. He referred several times to the robust pace of economic expansion, which accelerated in Q4 17. As a result, the Governing Council has strengthened its confidence that inflation will gradually converge towards the inflation objective of 2%. Both domestic demand and net exports remain supportive of growth. Despite the recent euro appreciation, stronger-than-expected global growth provides an impetus to EA exports, in spite of the strength of the currency. We forecast euro area growth in 2018 at 2.5% (ECB 2.3%) and expect the ECB to upgrade growth close to our forecast&nbsp;at the next ECB meeting in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, President Draghi delivered a dovish policy message, showing some concerns about the recent euro appreciation and rising market expectations about future policy rate hikes. He went as far as stating that, based on current data, he saw very little chance that interest rates could be raised this year. Similarly, president Draghi also emphasised the importance of being&nbsp;&ldquo;well past the end of net asset purchases&rdquo; for the first rate hike. We think that this message was aimed primarily at watering down the recent shift in market expectations and limiting the upside pressure on the the currency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Draghi stated that the discussion on amendments to forward guidance &ldquo;has not really started&rdquo;, in Draghi&rsquo;s own words. He explained that the account of the December meeting may have been mis-interpreted, suggesting that the discussion on forward guidance (FG) would start soon, but not meaning that the forward guidance would be adjusted soon. Our view is that an adjustment of the FG will likely be announced in April, will disentangle the exit from negative rates from the hiking cycle, and link the hiking cycle to actual progress in the path of inflation toward the ECB target. President Draghi repeated the three main conditions required to start removing monetary accommodation, namely 1)&nbsp; inflation should be on a path that reaches the target in the medium term; 2) the ECB needs to have confidence on the degree of convergence towards the target; and 3) convergence has to be self-supported (ie,&nbsp;it has to be there without monetary policy support). Moreover, once adjustment has progressed enough, monetary policy will still stay very accommodative, as there will be asset reinvestments and interest rates will stay low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Draghi also noted that since the last meeting, the expected path of interest rates has increased and the euro has appreciated. He admitted that the GC discussed this issue and considered there were&nbsp;three reasons: 1) further improvement in the economic situation; 2) increased market sensitivity to perceived changes; 3) non-ECB communications about the currency (in reference to the US). He was particularly vocal&nbsp;about recent statements on FX markets (from US officials), which are perceived as being non-compliant with the terms of reference agreed in Washington at the IMFC meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>President Draghi clarified that there will still need to be a discussion within the GC about the end of QE, therefore mentioning three options to be discussed: 1) sudden stop of net asset purchases; 2) extension; or 3) gradual tapering. We think the GC will opt during the summer for the sudden stop, based on economic strength and further progress toward the inflation target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked about the compliance of the APP with the capital key rule, he stated that the rule applies to the stock of asset purchases, not to monthly gross purchases, which can deviate quite substantially from the capital key because of the composition of the portfolio in terms of maturities and short-term market conditions. Asked about financial stability risks related to negative interest rates for a long period of time, Vice President Constancio answered that there was no evidence of overstretched valuations, with the exception of some high yield bonds and commercial real estate markets in some member states, which have deployed macro-prudential tools to address these problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Our Baseline ECB Call:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the January ECB meeting, we maintain our baseline policy path for the ECB, namely: 1) an adjustment of the forward guidance on rates, to be decided at the April meeting, focusing on the future path for rates and disentangling the exit from negative rates and the hiking cycle; 2) the end of the asset purchase programme in September, although re-investment of maturing securities would likely continue at least until 2020; and 3) a first increase in the depo rate by 20bp in December, followed by another increase in March 2019 that would leave the policy rate at zero at least until end-2019. Admittedly, further meaningful appreciation of the euro would clearly put our call on the ECB at risk, as it would imply a more gradual normalisation &ndash; on a multilateral basis the euro has appreciated by c. 9% since February 2017.</p>\r\n",

The US admin had ample opportunity to tweak weak Dollar language and ease trade war tensions, but declined and the DXY duly declined further towards the next tech supports just below 88.500 and above 88.250 (88.423 is a Fib retracement level and 88.282 the 200 DMA) despite attempts by some EU officials to turn the tide (SNB President Jordan and Italian Finance Minister for example). ECB&rsquo;s Draghi did not expressly comment about Eur strength, though did repeat concern about currency market volatility and GC worries about a potential change in US policy, so Eur/Usd extended gains through more chart resistance on the way to and through 1.2500 (reaching 1.2535 at one stage and surpassing the ECB event risk range inferred by options in the process). Cable recovered 1.4300+ status and almost hit 1.4350 and Usd/Jpy hit fresh lows below 109.00 and not far off key &lsquo;support&rsquo; seen at 108.50. Usd/Chf lost 0.9300 regardless of the aforementioned Swiss CB intervention threat and eyeing the 0.9251 Black Monday low next, while Usd/Cad shrugged off negative NAFTA headlines and mixed Canadian retail sales data to trade sub-1.2300. Aud/Usd is back on track to reclaim 0.8100 (vs 2017&rsquo;s 0.8125 best), but Nzd/Usd continued to struggle just above 0.7350 (vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 0.7400-plus high) following Q4 CPI miss overnight. Usd/Cnh collapsed again after a short squeeze late in the Asian session as the Dollar&rsquo;s losing streak resumed and shows little signing of ending.</p>\r\n",

Overnight, the USD printed a fresh 3yr low after dipping through 89.00 and moving towards key support situated at 88.25 (50% Fib retrace of rally from 72.65 to 109.89).&nbsp; Subsequently, <strong>GBP</strong> continued its stellar gains to move above 1.43, while <strong>USD/CHF</strong> briefly broke through the 94.25/50 support area which has been in place for 2yrs. However, the <strong>USD</strong> has found some slight reprieve amid talk of suspected FX intervention in Asian currencies (<strong>CNH</strong> and <strong>JPY</strong>) and as such has reclaimed 89.00. As many begin to ask the question of potential currency wars, participants will look to Draghi&rsquo;s post rate decision press conference on whether he will address recent <strong>EUR</strong> strength. Elsewhere, <strong>NZD</strong> had been hit by much weaker than expected Q4 NZ inflation data, which has prompted analysts to push back their rate hike expectations to mid-19. <strong>NOK </strong>relatively unfazed by the latest Norges Decision which saw the bank stand pat on rates and reiterate the findings of the December analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core bonds have retreated a bit further from opening/earlier session peaks, with <strong>Bunds</strong> down to 160.37 (-3 ticks vs +30 ticks at the Eurex peak) and eyeing recent lows only a few ticks lower that have continued to thwart fixed bears and protect serious attacks on the January/2018 base. <strong>Gilts</strong> have now been as low as 122.81 (-5 ticks vs +24 ticks at the Liffe best), while <strong>US Treasuries</strong> are off overnight peaks amidst some 10 year selling. <strong>UST</strong> futures are still holding a firmer line and re-flattening after reverse moves on Wednesday, with perhaps even more focus than usual on the 7 year note auction given its normal popularity with foreign buyers, but amidst the broad Dollar demise and the trade protectionism tit for tat being waged in Davos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Onward and upwards for commodity prices which have benefitted from the aforementioned USD weakness</strong>.

        "content": "<p>Another day, another rout in the USD index, as Asian participants were able to react to yesterday&rsquo;s comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who stated that USD weakness is good for the US in the short term. Overnight, the USD printed a fresh 3yr low after dipping through 89.00 and moving towards key support situated at 88.25 (50% Fib retrace of rally from 72.65 to 109.89). &nbsp;Subsequently, GBP continued its stellar gains to move above 1.43, while USDCHF briefly broke through the 94.25/50 support area which has been in place for 2yrs. However, the USD has found some slight reprieve amid talk of suspected FX intervention in Asian currencies (CNH and JPY) and as such has reclaimed 89.00. As many begin to ask the question of potential currency wars, participants will look to Draghi&rsquo;s post rate decision press conference on whether he will address recent EUR strength. Elsewhere, NZD had been hit by much weaker than expected Q4 NZ inflation data, which has prompted analysts to push back their rate hike expectations to mid-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from some understandable pre-ECB caution and defensive trade/positioning, market contacts suggest a technical motive behind the latest pull-back in Bunds given a small chart gap at 160.55. However, after&nbsp;mainly upbeat commentary from Ifo&rsquo;s chief economist the core German bond has probed a bit further to the downside amidst stops and has slipped to 160.47, so far. Next support area seen between 160.32-30, which held on Wednesday and has kept bears from challenging this month&rsquo;s 160.11 low. Meanwhile, Gilts are still largely taking their cues from Bunds and US Treasuries in the absence of anything major on the UK agenda (just UK housing loan and consumer credit data on tap) and sitting towards the bottom of the 122.88-123.10 Liffe range so far vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.86 close. UST futures holding a firmer line and re-flattening after reverse moves on Wednesday, with perhaps even more focus than usual on the 7 year note auction given its normal popularity with foreign buyers, but amidst the broad Dollar demise and the trade protectionism tit for tat being waged in Davos.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Majority of European bourses are trading with minor gains, aside from the DAX which has faltered amid the rising EUR weighing on exporters. Tech names the underperforming sector this morning having taken the impetus from their US counterparts. Additionally, in terms of stock specific, Aryzta is the worst performing stock after the company announced a profit warning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Onward&nbsp;and upwards for commodity prices which have benefitted from the aforementioned USD weakness. Brent crude futures briefly took out the USD 71.00 handle, in terms of levels to the upside, 71.66 (50% Fib retrace of decline from USD 116.1 to USD 27.23 may provide near term resistance.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The DXY and Dollar in general has benefited from some short covering, with Usd/Jpy, Usd/Myr (after an expected 25 bp Malaysian rate hike) and Usd/Cnh all bought in late Asian trade by a variety of accounts. The index is back above 0.8900 amidst broad recovery gains and retests of big figure levels that were hit or surpassed amidst the wave of all round Usd selling yesterday and overnight. However, the partial recovery and respite looks fragile as US officials maintain that the weaker Greenback is good for trade, albeit Treasury Secretary Mnuchin adding that its value will reflect healthy economic fundamentals in the longer term. Eur/Usd has eased back to pivot 1.2400 vs almost 1.2460 highs ahead of the ECB meeting, Cable is back under 1.4300 and Usd/Jpy above 109.00 from 108.75 at one stage. Usd/Cad has reclaimed 1.2300+ status as NAFTA discussions continue and Usd/Chf has bounced over 0.9400. Aud/Usd just fell short of the 0.8125 peak from 2017 and is currently sub-0.8100, but holding up better than its Nzd peer (below 0.7350 vs 0.7400+ at best) with the Kiwi hit by much weaker than expected Q4 NZ inflation data. Elsewhere, Eur/Nok is weaker circa 9.5800 awaiting the Norges Bank rate verdict (no change expected). &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Consensus for the main Ifo business readings indicate some moderation, but the bias appears firmly to the upside of the median forecasts given ZEW beats and other robust data/upbeat economic projections. Moreover, the risk skew around the tone of the ECB statement and President Draghi&rsquo;s press conference/Q&amp;A seems more hawkish or at least less dovish, albeit balanced to acknowledge the impact of Eur strength on inflation. Hence, it looks like a fade rally day for Bunds and the core bond has already drifted back to a 160.57 low vs Wednesday&rsquo;s 160.40 close.</p>\r\n",

The US auctioned $34bln of 5-year notes in an average sale, tailing by 0.4bps despite better cover than the prior auction. Internals were mostly in-line with recent averages, though the auction was, perhaps, not as bad as some had feared given today&rsquo;s steeper Treasury curve.

ASX 200 (-0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.9%) are lower with Japanese exporters feeling the brunt after USD/JPY briefly slipped to below 109.00, while losses in Australia have been stemmed as miners benefit from the recent USD-induced commodity rally. Hang Seng (-0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) are also downbeat after the PBoC skipped open market operations and amid trade war concerns due to protectionist messages from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Ross at Davos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback languishes after yesterday&rsquo;s comments from US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that the weaker USD is good for trade. This further added to the ongoing USD-dump and saw EUR/USD and GBP/USD reclaim the 1.2400 and 1.4200 handles respectively, while USD/JPY briefly slipped to below 109.00 for the first time since September. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies were also underpinned by gains in energy and metals, although NZD/USD then took a dive after a miss on Q4 CPI data which led to speculation that the market would have push back calls for a rate hike later this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower on spill-over selling from their US counterparts, with demand is also dampened ahead of a 20yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
