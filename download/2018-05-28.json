Bourses gave up losses amid growing uncertainty in Italy, after President Mattarella summoned former-IMF senior director Cottarelli to meet in an attempt to form a technocratic government. This followed Mattarella&rsquo;s rejection of Eurosceptic Economy Minister Paolo Savona, impeding the M5S-League coalition government to go ahead. Later in the session, Italy&#39;s PM-designate Cottarelli accepted the mandate to form a technocratic government as expected, eyeing elections at the start of next year (previously it was cited September 9th). Reports also followed that M5S leader Di Maio wants elections as soon as possible. Il Sole 24 Ore reported that the ex-IMF official Cottarelli could be named both Finance Minister and PM and he is expected to release a list of ministers to President Mattarella tonight or tomorrow morning. The FTSE MIB closed lower by 1.8% hitting a 12-weeks low at -2.7% in the session, BTPs also continued to post losses seen last week, despite the temporary boost given by Bunds at the open which slipped below 160.

On the news, the IBEX 35 slipped below 9800 and closed -0.5% lower whilst EURUSD accelerated its descent and broke the 1.1640, and continued to print session lows moving towards 1.1600 amid uncertainty growing in Europe. Though PM Rajoy previously defended his position by saying a no confidence motion is bad for the country, and subsequently ruled out a snap election, leader of the Citizen Party Rivera has said the only option is to hold fresh elections in Spain.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: Italian EUR-phoria short-lived as latest developments cloud the political outlook",
        "content": "<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European bourses (Eurostoxx 50 +0.3%) have kicked the week off on a positive footing following prospects of the US-North Korea summit being back in play after President Trump mentioned a US team was sent to make arrangements and following an unannounced inter-Korean meeting between Moon and Kim. Sentiment in Europe has also been supported by Italian politics after Italy PM-designate Conte reportedly gave up on efforts of forming a government after Italian President Mattarella rejected Eurosceptic Paolo Savona for the Economy Minister. The rejection of the Eurosceptic candidate has been seen as a market-friendly outcome and subsequently led the FSTE MIB (+0.1%) to outperform at the open with the FTSE Italia All-share bank index opening higher by 3%. However, gains have been scaled back in recent trade as markets digest the potential fallout of the decision by Mattarella which has lead to greater uncertainty in Italian politics. President Mattarella has reportedly summoned former-IMF senior director Cottarelli to meet today in a move viewed by some as laying the groundwork for a technocratic government; something which has been strongly opposed by the 5SM and League with Di Maio subsequently calling for Mattarella&rsquo;s impeachment. Elsewhere in the equity space, energy names lag their peers, in-fitting with price action in the complex with moves otherwise tamed by UK and US participants away from market today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR has been a key focus for markets today given the aforementioned developments in Italian politics. Subsequently the EUR gained ground against its major counterparts which lifted EUR/USD (temporarily) back above 1.1700 to the upside, subsequently pushing the DXY back below 94.00 to trade lower on the day before a bulk of the initial moves were scaled back as markets remain uncertain over what is next to happen next in what&rsquo;s been a particularly tumultuous process thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY has traded relatively choppy as the initial upside from the revival of the US-North Korea summit hopes was short-lived after the pair met resistance at the 21DMA at 109.80 with light volumes unable to stage a more meaningful move higher in the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For commodity-related currencies, the CAD has been hampered by sell-off in energy markets with traders also mindful of Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC rate decision, ahead of which RBC look for unchanged at 1.25% and note that consistent with their current guidance and &ldquo;and a firmer growth profile in the rest of 2018 &ndash; we anticipate the next hike from the BoC to come in July&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP currently trading with little in the way of firm direction with UK traders away from market. Political headlines will likely come back into the forefront after last week&rsquo;s slew of tier 1 data released with the latest reports suggesting that sources state the UK is lacking a plan in the event of a &#39;no-deal&#39; Brexit, thus making it virtually impossible for May to walk out of negotiations with the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the UK and US away from market today, price action has naturally been led by European paper with the main theme as discussed above being that of Italian politics. At the Eurex open Bunds opened lower and slipped below 160.50 with support for BTPs in a reversal of the price action seen on Friday with the open seeing the IT/GE spread narrowing by around 15bps. However, as seen across FX markets and the equity space, the trend was unwound throughout the morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil has extended the losses seen on Friday after OPEC members Russia and Saudi Arabia announced the intention to increase production in Q3 2018. WTI and Brent are both down 1.7% and 1.5% respectively. Meanwhile, US oil production showed no signs of abating on Friday, as rig counts continue to increase, hitting 1059 vs. a previous 1046.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals complex, Gold is seeing a sell-off (-0.34%) as safe-haven demand subsides following renewed hope of a US-North Korea summit. Steel futures have hit a one-week peak as Chinese industrial profit data showed positivity.</p>\r\n",

However, it wasn&rsquo;t all smooth sailing as the region also digested a slump in crude prices following reports that Saudi Arabia and Russia are nearing an agreement to raise output. ASX 200 (-0.6%) was dragged by commodity names after WTI crude extended on last week&rsquo;s losses to briefly trade below USD 66.00/bbl and after iron ore also slipped nearly 4% on Friday. Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) lacked direction amid an indecisive currency, while Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.6%) were initially choppy amid the aforementioned opposing risk factors but then eventually traded positive after strong Industrial Profit growth and a tepid net liquidity injection of CNY 30bln.

Following the veto by Mattarella, M5S leader Di Maio said it is unclear what will happen in the next few months and that the President should be impeached for betraying the constitution, while League leader Salvini said Italians should vote again. (Newswires/Guardian) President Mattarella has reportedly summoned former-IMF senior director Cottarelli to meet today in a move viewed by some as laying the groundwork for a technocratic government.

Despite the uncertainty following the veto including the possibility of fresh elections, EUR strengthened across the board due to the rejection of the Eurosceptics and in turn, dragged the DXY back below the 94.00 level. Elsewhere, USD/JPY traded choppy as the initial upside from the revival of the US-North Korea summit hopes was counterbalanced by the crude slump, while commodity-linked currencies were mixed as the CAD suffered and antipodeans weathered the crude sell-off storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were lacklustre overnight following Friday&rsquo;s losses in which WTI crude futures extended on last week&rsquo;s decline of around 5% with another near 3% decline to briefly trade below USD 66/bbl after reports on Friday suggested that Saudi Arabia and Russia were nearing an agreement to raise production. Elsewhere, gold opened lower on renewed prospects for a summit US-North Korea summit, while copper consolidated overnight amid an initial choppy risk tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Energy Minister Novak said OPEC+ are likely to agree to gradually raise output and that proportional easing for OPEC+ members seems a fair option.

Treasuries caught a bid during European hours as safe haven assets drew demand, and stabilised near session highs as investors squared-up their books ahead of the long weekend in the US/UK. Most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve with 10yr yields higher by c.5bps, the front end of the curve was higher by c.3bps and the long end by c.4bps. 2s5s and 2s10s narrowed by c.2bps whilst 5s30 and 10s30s widened by c.2bps.

ASX 200 (-0.6%) is dragged by commodity names after WTI crude extended on last week&rsquo;s losses of around 5% with another near 3% decline to briefly trade below USD 66.00/bbl and after iron ore also slipped nearly 4% on Friday. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (Unch) lacks direction amid an indecisive currency and Chinese markets (Shanghai Comp. +0.1%, Hang Seng +0.5%) are also choppy amid the aforementioned opposing risk factors, while the PBoC also conducted a tame net liquidity injection of CNY 30bln and raised the rates on its 28-day reverse repos by 5bps which was inline with previous actions on other tenors post-March Fed-hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, EUR/USD is firmer and reclaimed the 1.1700 handle on reports that Italian PM-designate Conte gave up on forming a government after President Mattarella surprisingly rejected Eurosceptic Paolo Savona for the Economy Minister position. Despite the uncertainty following the veto including the possibility of fresh elections, EUR strengthened across the board due to the rejection of the Eurosceptics and in turn, dragged the DXY back below the 94.00 level. Elsewhere, USD/JPY trades choppy as the initial upside from the revival of the US-North Korea summit hopes is counterbalanced by the crude slump, while commodity-linked currencies are mixed as the CAD suffers and antipodeans weather the crude sell-off storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are relatively flat alongside indecisive trade for Tokyo stocks and amid a lack of BoJ rinban announcement.</p>\r\n",
