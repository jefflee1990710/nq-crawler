Analysts noted that markets have absorbed the first trade actions by the US (and China&rsquo;s retaliation) with calm, perhaps because the news had been discounted meaning that there was no real surprise, or perhaps because economic indicators have not suggested any fallout from trade wars, which some believe will give Trump further ammunition to take a bellicose approach. The constructive risk backdrop helped Asia stocks to follow their US counterparts in rallying on Monday, and the ES maintained its gradual, upward path, though hit resistance around 2785.

Boeing (BA) outperformed on reports the Saudi state airline is mulling an order of 777X widebody jets, potentially offsetting some of the 80 jets IranAir ordered, but likely won&rsquo;t be completed due to US re-imposing sanctions on Iran. Banking stocks were up ahead of the beginning of earnings season this week (JPM, C, WFC report Friday). An apparent cooling of trade war tensions also helped industrials CAT, LMT, NOC as well as BA. Snap Inc (SNAP) bounced on reports it has developed a visual product search feature that delivers users to Amazon (AMZN) listings. Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA) gained on news that Comcast (CMCSA) is seeking to line-up buyers for Fox&rsquo;s regional sports networks. Meanwhile, Comcast (CMCSA) is expected to make a formal $31bln bid for Sky (SKY LN) this week, according to Deadline Hollywood.

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, Treasuries down, dollar up, crude mixed. &nbsp;<br />* REAR-VIEW: Eurosceptics Davis and Johnson quit UK Cabinet; risk markets firm as trade war concerns put on back burner.<br />* COMING-UP: US JOLTS; API inventories; PepsiCo earnings; US 3yr note auction; UK industrial and manufacturing production.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Boris Johnson resigned as UK Foreign Secretary, following the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davis with both unhappy about the Brexit negotiating position UK PM May has agreed with her Cabinet. The former has been replaced by the pro-Brexit Dominic Raab, and Jeremy Hunt was named new Foreign Minister. Pricing of a BOE rate hike probability for August has fallen by around 6ppts in the day to around 60%, and bookies have narrowed the odds on May leaving her post as PM (one bookie quotes 2/1 on May to go this week, and quotes 5/6 to be gone in the next quarter; odds of a 2018 General Election has been cut to 6/4 from 5/1). Various media reports, however, suggest that the confidence motion is unlikely to hit on Monday; later, Conservative Party chairman said he does not expect a confidence vote against May. Ahead of Thursday&#39;s release of the long-awaited White Paper, which will outline the relationship the UK desires with the EU post-Brexit, UK PM May met with MPs on Monday in an attempt to rally them behind her position ahead of the debate in Parliament next Monday and Tuesday. The government has a majority of 10 in the Lower House, and it is becoming increasingly likely that she may face defeat on her negotiating position as a result of a Eurosceptic rebellion, which would raise the chances of a leadership challenge (48 Conservative MPs are needed to trigger a confidence vote, 159 out of the 316 Conservative MPs are needed to remove her from office). A spokesperson for the Prime Minister said she would fight any attempt to unseat her. However, fears that May could call a fresh General Election, which could result in a Labour Government, may keep the Tory rebels in check, some analysts said. In terms of the negotiating position itself, while May has achieved a &#39;victory&#39; in her Cabinet, it remains to be seen whether the EU will be amenable to the UK&#39;s &#39;third way&#39; position, with weekend commentary in some parts of Europe suggesting that the proposals are &quot;unacceptable&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:&nbsp;</strong>ECB&#39;s Draghi repeats rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure price goals are met. On trade, Draghi says EU can lend support to multilateralism and global trade, which have been cornerstones of growing economic prosperity over the past seven decades; says the threat of increased protectionism is more prominent. On the economy, Draghi says risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook remain broadly balanced, and underlying inflation is expected to pick up. ECB&#39;s Coeure said the ECB&#39;s June decision already accounts for the risks of trade wars. Coeure said that trade wars could have negative implications for the European economy, though at present, it is not strong enough to derail the recovery, and accordingly, there is no need to adjust the ECB&#39;s policy path. ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny said trade wars were not as dramatic than appeared on first sight, but noted there are still risks of an unintentional currency way, which could have a more serious impact. On policy, Nowotny generally reiterated the ECB&rsquo;s line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.9% at 2784, NDX +0.9% at 7276, DJI +1.3% at 24777. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +1.2%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.5%, Energy: +1.5%, Financials: +2.3%, Health Care: +0.7%, Industrials: +1.8%, Materials: +0.9%, Telecoms: -1.4%, Tech: +0.8%, Utilities: -3.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>Friday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Goldilocks&rsquo; jobs report in the US is being cited for the firm tone in risk assets at the beginning of the week (decent payroll growth, while earnings growth does not necessitate more aggressive FOMC tightening), with traders putting concerns of trade wars on the back burner.

Brent was buoyed by continuing tensions in Libya, where oil output has nearly halved since February to 527k BPD, according to the latest reports. Brent also continues to be supported by geopolitics relating to Iran, which has upped its belligerent rhetoric in recent days amid US calls for buyers to seek to buy crude form other sources (Kuwait on Monday hinted Asian buyers were looking to diversify away from Iran). WTI, meanwhile, has been pressured by news that SynCrude Canada will be restarting production from Fort Murray for the first time since 20 June, earlier than expected; but production is only expected to normalise in September. Accordingly, the arbitrage between Brent and WTI weakened, with the August/September WTI spread narrowing. &rdquo;While there is certainly a bullish undercurrent of sentiment here, with the Iranian supply question eventually expected to support a further rally, today&rsquo;s trade entails more rotation between the markets, with traders endeavoring to buy what&rsquo;s hot and sell what&rsquo;s not in search of the strongest gains,&rdquo; Citi&rsquo;s analysts said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Sterling was higher in early trading on news David Davis quit as Brexit Secretary, with the pound gaining on a &lsquo;softer Brexit&rsquo; theme. However, that wasn&rsquo;t the case when Boris Johnson quit as Foreign Secretary, which saw GBP breach 1.32 to the downside on fears that it could eventually lead to a challenge of UK PM May&rsquo;s leadership, which in turn may lead to a more hard line Brexiteer, or even a fresh General Election. However, these losses were pared back in evening trade after pro-Brexit lawmaker Rees-Mogg said PM May was not likely to face a confidence vote.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Dollar Index was trading on the back foot on a more constructive risk environment, as trade war feats eased. However, the slide in GBP was said to buoy the index, which trades above the 94.00 handle again, having fallen to 93.71 as traders reasoned the &lsquo;Goldilocks&rsquo; payrolls report on Friday was unlikely to push the Fed into a more aggressive course of tightening since job growth is still occurring while wage growth remains elusive, potentially signalling more slack in the US labour market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* MXN: </strong>The peso slipped against the USD after June CPI data showed CPI coming in slightly ahead of expectations, with energy pushing prices higher at the end of Q2, though analysts at Pantheon said that inflation is coming under control. Later, Banxico Deputy Governor Guzman said that amid high uncertainty and risks, erring on the side of caution will usually be preferable; economy has not yet been affected by the Banxico&#39;s policy stance; on inflation, Guzman said the Banxico&rsquo;s efforts in reining price pressures was encouraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRY: </strong>The lira sank against the dollar, with USDTRY spiking to 4.6875 as President Erdogan announced his son-in-law would take the role of Treasury and Finance minister, with no room in his cabinet for the market friendly former Deputy PM Mehmet Simsek. The Lira was trading at around 4.6020 prior to Erdogan&rsquo;s announcements.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index has drifted a bit further below 94.000 towards 93.700, partly amidst more reflection on Friday&rsquo;s sub-forecast US average earnings and unexpected upturn in the jobless rate, but also as several of the Dollar&rsquo;s major rivals rallied independently. In terms of technical levels, there is little in the way of support or resistance for the DXY, but 93.500 is an obvious downside level to watch from a psychological perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/GBP/EUR &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All winners vs the flagging Greenback for various reasons and to different degrees, with the Aud inching closer to 0.7500 after breaking resistance between 0.7440-50, but faced with a couple of chart hurdles in advance of the big figure (fib at 0.7494 and 50 DMA at 0.7498). A short squeeze has been the main driver for the Aud, which has also seen the NZD cross back over 1.0900 as the Kiwi struggles to clear 0.6850 vs the Usd. Cable has (finally) lost grip of the 1.3300 handle again amidst yet more UK Government instability on Brexit divisions, with David Davis resigning in protest at PM May&rsquo;s &lsquo;soft&rsquo; White Paper and Foreign Minister Boris Johnson following suit. Gbp did climb above 1.3350 earlier and recover from a sub-1.3300 retreat, but the volatile moves also set against broad Greenback fluctuations, and UK PM May is expected to make a statement soon (15.30BST touted). Elsewhere, Eur/Usd is now drifting back having got to within 10 pips of 1.1800, with little independent impetus coming from either ECB President Draghi or renowned hawk Novotny as they both largely stuck to June policy meeting guidance (for QE to end after December 2018 and rates to go up after Summer next year at the earliest).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY/PLN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots of focus on the Lira ahead of President Erdogan&rsquo;s official swearing in ceremony, with EM investors initially lifting the Try close to 4.5100 vs the Usd on hopes that he would retain market friendly personnel in key Government positions, but then the currency sold sharply on changes to CBRT laws by decree that effectively give him more control over the appointments of Deputy Governors. Usd/Try now back up near 4.6000. Conversely, the Zloty is a marked outperformer vs the Eur (over 4.3150 at one stage) after last week&rsquo;s firm inflation data altered dovish perceptions regarding the NBP policy outlook.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires) UK PM May is said to have promised to fire UK Foreign Minister Johnson if he undermines the new Brexit negotiating position, according to reports on Friday. (The Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Environment Minister Gove said the Brexit plan is a realistic compromise, while he also commented the UK will not walk away from the negotiations now but should be willing to if a &quot;proper&quot; withdrawal from the EU cannot be reached. (Newswires/BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg is to vote against UK PM May&#39;s Brexit plan, while there were also reports that Brexiteer MPs threaten to topple PM May and replace her with Jacob Rees-Mogg in anger at the PM&rsquo;s Chequers deal. Furthermore, Jacob Rees-Mogg more recently commented that UK PM May&#39;s Brexit plan must be bad if Davis cannot support it and that a serious mistake by PM May led to Davis quitting. (Telegraph/Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU countries were said to be lobbying EU Brexit negotiator Barnier not to reject the UK White Paper. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>British Chambers of Commerce said UK manufacturing and services companies&rsquo; domestic sales picked up slightly during Q2 but UK business investment plans and confidence weakened, while it added BoE rhetoric around hiking rates seems ill-judged. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Coeure said the ECB is not complacent to trade-war risks and that its June decision considered trade and other risks, while he added that Euro zone economy remains strong and that rate guidance has been effective.

However, the single currency is fairing much better vs a generally soft USD following the weaker than forecast elements of last Friday&rsquo;s US jobs report, with a Fib breached around 1.1720 and peak around 1.1780, opening up scope to 1.1800, while the DXY has extended losses to just below 93.800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc is also benefiting on the back of the Greenback&rsquo;s demise, to trade near 0.9850, and with little reaction to somewhat mixed Swiss unemployment data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CAD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All pretty flat, with the Kiwi capped around 0.6850 and somewhat outflanked by its antipodean neighbour as the Aud/Nzd cross rebounds above 1.0900. The Loonie is holding in a relatively tight 1.3100-1.3070 range vs its US rival, while Usd/Jpy continues to pivot 110.50.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks begin the week higher across the board as region follows suit to Wall St&rsquo;s performance on Friday following a Goldilocks US jobs report in which Non-Farm Payrolls topped estimates, while Average Earnings was softer than expected and Unemployment Rate surprisingly increased to 4.0% which places doubts on the Fed&rsquo;s Unemployment projections for a decline to 3.6% for the current year. The broad appetite for risk saw all majors gains from the open with the ASX 200 (+0.2%) led higher by mining stocks including BHP amid reports BP is front running the bidding for its US shale assets and with Nikkei 225 (+1.2%) supported by a predominantly weaker currency. Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.5%) conform to the upside with broad gains across the sectors in both indices and which follows the PBoC snapping its recent streak of liquidity drains, while focus in Hong Kong also turned to Xiaomi which declined over 4% in early trade on its debut due to valuation concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY remains subdued and below the 94.00 level in the wake of the mixed US jobs data in which a higher Unemployment Rate and softer wage growth casted doubts on Fed forecasts and slightly dampened expectations for 4 hikes this year. This saw the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts extend their gains with EUR/USD testing its highest level in over 3 weeks, while GBP/USD is also firmer on PM May&rsquo;s soft Brexit proposal despite a bout of pressure on the resignation of Brexit Secretary Davis and Brexit Ministers Baker and Braverman. Elsewhere, commodity-linked currencies have gained amid strength in oil and metals prices, which also coincides with a firmer CNH following a larger than expected increase in Chinese Foreign Reserves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs was subdued as focus was centred around stocks and amid a lack of Rinban announcement, although downside was also stemmed with prices remaining near its best levels since May and at close proximity to retest the 151.00 level.</p>\r\n",
