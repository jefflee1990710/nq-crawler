        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP 6 July 2018: Goldilocks payroll report helps stocks rise amid trade tensions ",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:&nbsp;Equities up, Treasuries up, DXY down, Crude mixed.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Goldilocks NFP report; Mixed CAD labour data unlikely to stop BOC; EU&#39;s Barnier urges Brexit progress; May meets Cabinet on Brexit.<br />* NEXT WEEK: BoC rate decision; ECB Minutes; US PPI and CPI; US earnings season begins.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>After US tariffs on USD 34bln of Chinese goods came into effect on Friday, China&#39;s Foreign Ministry confirmed tariffs have been implemented on some US goods in retaliation, but did not provide details on implementation. China PM Li remains committed to further opening up markets to other countries, he said, adding that a trade war is never a solution, but if any party resorts to an increase of tariffs, China would take measures in response. It was also reported the China Ministry of Commerce has lodged a case against the US at the WTO; China&#39;s state newspaper Xinhua wrote US tariffs on Chinese goods are &#39;doomed to fail&#39; and the US&rsquo; &lsquo;bully boy&rsquo; tactics will ultimately prove unsuccessful. Russia has also imposed 25%-40% import duties on some US products, targeting equipment for construction, oil &amp; gas and mining. Meanwhile, the Europeans are reportedly preparing fresh tariffs on the US worth around EUR 18bln, targeting staple goods such as ketchup, frozen fish, raisins and adhesive bandages, the FT reported. In the UK, the US Ambassador to Britain said people in all government departments are looking how to put together a UK-US trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Russia&rsquo;s Foreign Minister said Russia and China are interested in saving the Iranian nuclear deal. Iranian Official then reported Iran is fully prepared for a collapse of the Iran nuclear deal and has called on powers to take measures to salvage it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>EU Brexit negotiator Barnier said there are still too many questions in Brexit negotiations, and not enough answers, adding that there is still a long way to go and little time left; Barnier also urged PM May to reconsider the rejected Irish plan. UK PM May is presenting her Brexit option to her Cabinet members at Chequers, ahead of next week&rsquo;s unveiling of her White Paper, which the EU will consider (the Telegraph reported that the UK will sign a formal treaty with the EU after Brexit that will tie the UK to the EU&rsquo;s rules on goods, which does not seem acceptable by pro-Brexit Cabinet members). The Cabinet remains split, and there are plenty of suggestions of Eurosceptic members plotting against the PM, and accordingly, it would be wise to keep an eye out for &lsquo;leaks&rsquo; over the weekend. On a more positive note, reports suggested that EU countries are lobbying Bernier not to reject the White Paper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DATA:&nbsp;</strong>The US economy added 213k nonfarm payrolls in June, slightly above the 195k consensus, and net revisions amounted to +37k. Whilst the latest softer ISM Non-Mfg pointed to a sub-200k NFP figure, the US employment report does not seem to reflect the negative impact of a trade war just yet, analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said. The job gains remain strong across the board showing manufacturing jobs rising by 36k &ndash; the highest since December. The unemployment rate ticked a touch higher to 4% from 3.8% on the back of increased participation. Pantheon argues that if payroll growth remains anywhere near 200k, the unemployment trend should target 3.5% by the end of the year. Average Earnings y/y came in at 2.7%, missing expectations at 2.8%, with this month showing a 0.2%, retreating from the 0.3% posted in May, and signalling a slight deceleration, which analysts say may keep the Fed &lsquo;s view unchanged on the labour market ahead of the next hike this year, likely in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADA LABOUR MARKET DATA: </strong>Mixed labour market data unlikely to stop BOC from hiking next week.&nbsp;The Bank of Canada is expected to lift rates by 25bps to 1.50% at its meeting next week for the second time in 2018. The implied probability a rate rise rose slightly after the latest batch of labour market data (moving from around 80% to 86%); although the data was mixed, the data provided little that is likely to sway the Bank&rsquo;s opinion that the Canadian economy is operating close to full potential. The BOC is more likely to be influenced by GDP data and its Business Outlook Survey, RBC writes, and the recent prints will offer the central bank some encouragement. &ldquo;The economy has evolved roughly in line with their April MPR forecast, including Q1 GDP at 1.3% annualized and a projected bounce-back to above 2.0% growth in Q2. The recent Business Outlook Survey was very strong (BOS indicator at 3.11), highlighted by rising capacity &amp; price pressures.&rdquo; RBC makes the case that it makes sense for the BOC to further remove accommodation given rates are currently knocking around 125bps beneath the bottom-end of its estimate of the neutral rate (between 2.5% and 3.5%), as well as the BOC&rsquo;s increasing discomfort with negative real rates. A hike is unlikely to surprise markets, given the decent incoming data and recent positive comments from Governor Poloz; global trade tensions will likely add some caution to the BOC&rsquo;s policy approach, and Poloz will likely face many questions on the subject at the post-meeting press conference, particularly since the FOMC expressed concerns on the matter in its latest set of meeting minutes.

In the afternoon, amid thin trading conditions, ES was consolidating sideways around the 2760 level, and closes out the cash session near highs of the day. On the week, ES finishes positive snapping two weeks of declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCKS SPECIFICS: </strong>Biogen (BIIB) led the SPX and lifted the other biotech stocks after it announced final positive results for a mid-stage trial of an Alzheimer drug. Tech stocks rallied led by Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Boeing (BA) was lower amid its large dependence on China, but reversed losses seen in early trade as equities rose. Elsewhere, JPMorgan (JPM) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China were said to be showing interest in acquiring a stake in Deutsche Bank (DBK GY), though JPMorgan have since denied the reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* M&amp;A: </strong>EchoStar (SATS) was up more than 2% after Inmarsat rejected the higher takeover offer for GBP 0.532/shr for a total of GBP 3.2bln and in late afternoon reported no intention of making a formal takeover offer for the co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLES 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-11.</strong> Treasuries drifted mildly higher and the yield curve continued to flatten, though the complex gave up most of the gains seen after the solid NFP report and as equities continued to climb higher. Yields across the curve were higher by c.1bps. 10s30 narrowed by c.1bps whilst all the other spread widened by less than 1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLE $0.86 HIGHER AT $73.80/BBL; BRENT (U8) SETTLES $0.28 LOWER AT $77.11/BBL. </strong>It was a relatively uneventful session for crude oil news flow, leaving traders to focus on data (US payrolls), as well as trade tensions. Crude was mixed: Brent traded negative with traders continue to cite the increase in Saudi production reported this week. Some have also attributed the Brent weakness to news that Aramco is mulling delaying its long-awaited IPO (was expected late 2018/early 2019) which would suggest that there is leeway for the Saudis to focus on market stability, rather than a higher oil price. WTI, meanwhile, was up on reported short-covering, according to Reuters. The relative quiet in newsflow also left traders to look at the spread between WTI/Brent, with the September contract arbitrage falling beneath $6, which analysts at Citi say is a continuation of the rebalancing seen from the wides observed in May. And even two weeks after the OPEC+ meeting, there does not seem to be a consensus on how much crude production will be ramped up to offset the widely-reported outages due to geopolitics and other supply constraints; South Korea on Friday is reportedly set to halt all purchases of Iranian crude for the first time since August 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FX WEEKLY WRAP: </strong>The broad Dollar and index were already being buffeted by the $34 bn tit-for-tat US vs China import tariffs and relative strength in rival currencies for separate reasons, but the final straw for the Greenback came via NFP and sub-forecast average earnings over stronger than expected headline payrolls and upward revisions to the previous 2 months. Hence, the DXY has retreated further and is testing bids/support around the psychological 94.000 marker having been just above 95.000 at the start of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* NZD: Ending Friday and the week overall as the strongest G10 currency, but not really on anything fundamentally positive for the Kiwi, as the latest GDT auction showed an even bigger deceleration in prices and other macro releases were mixed if not downbeat. Rather, re-positioning, short-covering and a technical correction from oversold territory appears to have combined to lift the Nzd vs its US counterpart and reclaim 0.6800+ (almost 0.6850) vs just under 0.6700 at the other extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EUR : Another big winner vs the Usd, and largely on latest ECB &lsquo;source&rsquo; stories (though a couple of significant German data beats also helped) suggesting that some GC members are of the opinion that policy would be behind the curve if rates were hiked at the end of 2019 in line with some market expectations. The single currency has cleared psychological resistance and mega option expiry hedge flow at 1.1700 as a result, and is now above 1.1750 from sub-1.1600 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* AUD: Riding on the back of the Kiwi recovery to some extent after the tide turned down under, but even though the cross pulled back below 1.0900 from nearly 1.1000 at the peak the Aud eventually breached offers around 0.7400 to test 0.7450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* GBP: A clean sweep of above consensus UK PMIs, and an especially upbeat survey from the key services sector boosted the Pound, with HIS Markit predicting Q2 GDP growth of 0.4% q/q and BoE Governor Carney sounding pretty positive about the economic and inflation outlook after a more outright hawkish speech from Saunders (no real shock as the latter is 1 of the 3 rate hike dissenters). Cable is now testing its 30 DMA around 1.3272 having been just shy of 1.3100 on Monday, but could remain capped ahead of 1.3300 given Brexit risk via the Chequers meeting to try and find an EU customs union arrangement that satisfies all sides involved (ie a divided UK parliament and Brussels).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* CAD: Lots of varied impulses for the Loonie ahead of next Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy meeting that is widely expected to result in a 25 bp tightening move and this view underscored by latest Canadian jobs data revealing a better than anticipated payrolls total, but not so strong internals as part-time employment accounted for the bulk of the gain. In terms of non-data drivers, choppy oil prices were a factor and a strong IVEY PMI also added some survey-based support for the Cad to trade at circa 1.3090 vs the Usd against 1.3225 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* JPY, CHF: Both relatively rangebound amidst a lack of independent impetus, with Usd/Jpy trading between 111.15-110.25 all week and the Franc equally constrained from 0.9880-0.9965 &ndash; bang in line Swiss CPI not really helping the Chf deviate further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* EM: Decent recoveries for the Rand, Lira and Peso vs the Usd, but the Real faded somewhat and TRY could be undermined by Cabinet appointments if deemed market unfriendly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: German Trade Balance.

Crude was mixed: Brent traded negative with traders continue to cite the increase in Saudi production reported this week. Some have also attributed the Brent weakness to news that Aramco is mulling delaying its long-awaited IPO (was expected late 2018/early 2019) which would suggest that there is leeway for the Saudis to focus on market stability, rather than a higher oil price. WTI, meanwhile, was up on reported short-covering, according to Reuters. The relative quiet in newsflow also left traders to look at the spread between WTI/Brent, with the September contract arbitrage falling beneath $6, which analysts at Citi say is a continuation of the rebalancing seen from the wides observed in May. And even two weeks after the OPEC+ meeting, there does not seem to be a consensus on how much crude production will be ramped up to offset the widely-reported outages due to geopolitics and other supply constraints; South Korea on Friday is reportedly set to halt all purchases of Iranian crude for the first time since August 2012.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The broad Dollar and index were already being buffeted by the $34 bn tit-for-tat US vs China import tariffs and relative strength in rival currencies for separate reasons, but the final straw for the Greenback came via NFP and sub-forecast average earnings over stronger than expected headline payrolls and upward revisions to the previous 2 months. Hence, the DXY has retreated further and is testing bids/support around the psychological 94.000 marker having been just above 95.000 at the start of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Friday and the week overall as the strongest G10 currency, but not really on anything fundamentally positive for the Kiwi, as the latest GDT auction showed an even bigger deceleration in prices and other macro releases were mixed if not downbeat. Rather, re-positioning, short-covering and a technical correction from oversold territory appears to have combined to lift the Nzd vs its US counterpart and reclaim 0.6800+ (almost 0.6850) vs just under 0.6700 at the other extreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big winner vs the Usd, and largely on latest ECB &lsquo;source&rsquo; stories (though a couple of significant German data beats also helped) suggesting that some GC members are of the opinion that policy would be behind the curve if rates were hiked at the end of 2019 in line with some market expectations. The single currency has cleared psychological resistance and mega option expiry hedge flow at 1.1700 as a result, and is now above 1.1750 from sub-1.1600 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riding on the back of the Kiwi recovery to some extent after the tide turned down under, but even though the cross pulled back below 1.0900 from nearly 1.1000 at the peak the Aud eventually breached offers around 0.7400 to test 0.7450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A clean sweep of above consensus UK PMIs, and an especially upbeat survey from the key services sector boosted the Pound, with HIS Markit predicting Q2 GDP growth of 0.4% q/q and BoE Governor Carney sounding pretty positive about the economic and inflation outlook after a more outright hawkish speech from Saunders (no real shock as the latter is 1 of the 3 rate hike dissenters). Cable is now testing its 30 DMA around 1.3272 having been just shy of 1.3100 on Monday, but could remain capped ahead of 1.3300 given Brexit risk via the Chequers meeting to try and find an EU customs union arrangement that satisfies all sides involved (ie a divided UK parliament and Brussels).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lots of varied impulses for the Loonie ahead of next Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy meeting that is widely expected to result in a 25 bp tightening move and this view underscored by latest Canadian jobs data revealing a better than anticipated payrolls total, but not so strong internals as part-time employment accounted for the bulk of the gain. In terms of non-data drivers, choppy oil prices were a factor and a strong IVEY PMI also added some survey-based support for the Cad to trade at circa 1.3090 vs the Usd against 1.3225 at worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both relatively rangebound amidst a lack of independent impetus, with Usd/Jpy trading between 111.15-110.25 all week and the Franc equally constrained from 0.9880-0.9965 &ndash; bang in line Swiss CPI not really helping the Chf deviate further.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SCANDIS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A bullish week for the Sek and Nok was upset by disappointing data on Friday, but both Crowns are still holding decent net gains vs the Eur, with the former getting a leg-up from a hawkish Riksbank (reaffirmed end of 2018 hike guidance, but 2 Board members dissented).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decent recoveries for the Rand, Lira and Peso vs the Usd, but the Real faded somewhat and TRY could be undermined by Cabinet appointments if deemed market unfriendly.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.9%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) were positive as both indices took impetus from their US counterparts, in which the mining sector led the gains in Australia and the prior day&rsquo;s currency weakness provided some encouragement to Japanese exporters. Conversely, Hang Seng (+0.5%) initially weakened and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) briefly fell below the 2700 level for the first time since March 2016 amid the tit-for-tat tariffs and after PBoC inaction amounted to a considerable CNY 500bln net drain for the week before the indices finished in the green. The KOSPI (+0.7%) was also subdued with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics dampened on disappointing preliminary Q2 results, while Singapore Straits Times Index (-2.0%) slumped from the open with developers hit by a surprise announcement yesterday of higher stamp duty rates and tighter loan-to-value limits as part of measures to cool the property market. Finally, 10yr JGBs have seen mild support overnight amid the overall cautious tone in the Asia-Pac region and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 810bln in JGBs, but with upside capped by resistance around the 151.00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 500bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 370bln net drain.

However, there were also reports citing senior officials in Brussels that PM May&rsquo;s new plan will be &lsquo;dead on arrival&rsquo; and EU officials also stated any hint of the UK wanting to be part of the single market on goods but not on services will not be accepted. (Newswires/Telegraph/Independent) Overall, at least seven Cabinet ministers are expected to confront PM May today amid fears her Brexit plan will tie the UK to EU rules for the foreseeable future and put any US trade deal in jeopardy.

Shortly after, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said tariffs have been implemented on some US goods. Energy names lag on softer oil prices. In terms of individual stock movers, Deutsche Bank (+5.0%) shares were lifted by reports JP Morgan and ICBC are to take a stake in the company, JP Morgan have denied these reports, however.

However, trade remains lethargic overall into potentially big risk events and with US-China import tariffs being rolled out in the interim.

Back to debt markets, US Treasuries are mildly firmer and the curve fractionally flatter after somewhat mixed perceptions from latest FOMC minutes that ultimately did little to change views about Fed hike intentions for the remainder of the year, albeit with heightened attention on the aforementioned global trade war risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mostly lower with WTI (-0.1%) and Brent (-0.3%) pressured amid yesterday&rsquo;s surprise build in crude inventories fused with nervous trading as US-Sino trade war looms. Gold (-0.2%) is experiencing cautious trade ahead of the key US NFP due later today. Elsewhere, London copper (-0.1%, -5% this week) is set for the worst week since November 2015, down a fifth consecutive session as US tariffs kick in.</p>\r\n",

Bunds recently topped out at 162.78, +8 ticks vs -23 ticks at one stage, while Gilts managed to climb 1 tick above parity to 123.35 having been 17 ticks adrift at the low. However, trade remains lethargic overall into potentially big risk events and with US-China import tariffs being rolled out in the interim. Back to debt markets, US Treasuries are mildly firmer and the curve fractionally flatter after somewhat mixed perceptions from latest FOMC minutes that ultimately did little to change views about Fed hike intentions for the remainder of the year, albeit with heightened attention on the aforementioned global trade war risk.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the FOMC&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes generally were in line with the post-meeting statement and press conference with Chair Powell, there were a few new pieces of information that warrant attention with the Fed clearly concerned about the risks of global trade wars. In terms of a reaction, the market was undecided on how to interpret the minutes, with the market initially tilting dovish on the discussion of trade risks and the yield curve, before turning slightly hawkish as the Fed seems content to tighten policy as it has previously said it would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks traded mixed after the positive momentum from Wall St&rsquo;s best performance in over a month stalled as focus shifted to the US-China tariffs. ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.1%) were positive as both indices took impetus from their US counterparts, in which the mining sector led the gains in Australia and the prior day&rsquo;s currency weakness provided some encouragement to Japanese exporters. Conversely, Hang Seng (-0.5%) weakened and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) briefly fell below the 2700 level for the first time since March 2016 amid the tit-for-tat tariffs and after PBoC inaction amounted to a considerable CNY 500bln net drain for the week. The KOSPI (-0.3%) was also subdued with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics dampened on disappointing preliminary Q2 results, while Singapore Straits Times Index (-2.0%) slumped from the open with developers hit by a surprise announcement yesterday of higher stamp duty rates and tighter loan-to-value limits as part of measures to cool the property market. Finally, 10yr JGBs have seen mild support overnight amid the overall cautious tone in the Asia-Pac region and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 810bln in JGBs, but with upside capped by resistance around the 151.00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 500bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 370bln net drain. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.6336 (Prev. 6.6180)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump confirmed China tariffs will be imposed after Thursday midnight and said another USD 16bln in tariffs are coming in 2 weeks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />China Mofcom stated that it has to fight back against US on trade and that it will continue evaluating impact of US tariffs. Furthermore, Mofcom added that US action regarding tariffs is bullying and triggers global market turmoil. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />PBoC adviser Ma Jun said impact of US-China trade war is limited and sees US tariffs on USD 50bln of China goods to slow down China&#39;s growth by 0.2 ppts, while there were also comments from China Foreign Minister Wang Yi that China and EU should safeguard free trade and that China is willing to defend Iran accord with Europe. (Newswires/Xinhua)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is to unveil plans that involve UK agreeing to a formal treaty with EU post-Brexit that will tie the UK to Brussels rules on goods, according to reports in Telegraph. However, there were also reports citing senior officials in Brussels that PM May&rsquo;s new plan will be &lsquo;dead on arrival&rsquo; and EU officials also stated any hint of the UK wanting to be part of the single market on goods but not on services will not be accepted. (Newswires/Telegraph/Independent) Furthermore, it was also reported that UK Brexit minister David Davis is said to be fighting against PM May&#39;s Brexit White Paper and is said to oppose the plan to tie the UK to EU rules on goods. (Newswires) Overall, at least seven Cabinet ministers are expected to confront PM May today amid fears her Brexit plan will tie the UK to EU rules for the foreseeable future and put any US trade deal in jeopardy. (Times/Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Interior Minister Seehofer warned that EU rigidness regarding Brexit hinders reaching a security deal and puts lives at risk. (FT)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Germany&#39;s SPD and conservatives reached an agreement on turning back certain migrants at the German-Austrian border, according to coalition sources. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were rangebound with the DXY flat amid a lack of pertinent data overnight and following a relatively muted reaction to the FOMC Minutes which noted concern on trade policy risks but didn&rsquo;t suggest anything that would likely swerve the Fed from its hiking path. EUR/USD and GBP/USD were also contained in which the latter languished at the prior day&rsquo;s lows amid Brexit uncertainty with EU officials extremely doubtful on PM May&rsquo;s new plan. Elsewhere, high beta currencies (AUD, NZD &amp; CAD) were initially lacklustre due to trade concerns but later saw some support alongside gains in US equity futures amid comments from China&rsquo;s Mofcom which reiterated past statements and so far refrained from declaring an official retaliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mostly subdued alongside the cautious risk tone amid the US-China tariffs. Nonetheless, WTI crude futures are off worst levels and have reclaimed the USD 73.00/bbl level but remains far from making any significant recovery from the losses triggered by the recent surprise DoE crude inventory build. Elsewhere, gold was choppy following an indecisive reaction to the FOMC and with NFP data eyed next, while copper underperformed on China weakness and declined below the USD 2.80/lb level.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iranian President Rouhani told French President Macron that Europe&#39;s package of economic measures to make up for the US exit &#39;does not meet all the Iranian demands&#39;. (IRNA)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran&rsquo;s OPEC Governor stated that oil price above USD 100/bbl is yet to come and that President Trump is the one to be blamed. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CME raised NYMEX platinum future initial margins to USD 1870 per contract from USD 1650 per contract. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treasury complex drifted on Thursday, and closes out the session in the middle of its ~10 tick trading range. As US traders got to their desk, the TPLEX rose, likely in sympathy with the Bund, which caught a bid as Italian BTPs sold-off. There was some further upside after a mixed ISM survey (it appears Treasuries looked through the data), though the T-Note found sellers around 120-13+, and after fleeting knee-jerk higher post-Fed minutes, the T-Note continued its move lower towards the middle of the range, to finish flattish. The curve continued to flatten on Thursday, with 2s10s, 2s30s, 5s10s and 5s30s narrowing to lows not seen in a decade. Attention falls on tomorrow&rsquo;s payrolls data (preview below). US 10YR T-notes futures (u8) 2 ticks lower at 120-08.</p>\r\n",

Conversely, Hang Seng (-0.5%) weakened and Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) briefly fell below the 2700 level for the first time since March 2016 amid the tit-for-tat tariffs and after PBoC inaction amounted to a considerable CNY 500bln net drain for the week. The KOSPI (-0.3%) was also subdued with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics dampened on disappointing preliminary Q2 results, while Singapore Straits Times Index (-2.0%) slumped from the open with developers hit by a surprise announcement yesterday of higher stamp duty rates and tighter loan-to-value limits as part of measures to cool the property market. Finally, 10yr JGBs have seen mild support overnight amid the overall cautious tone in the Asia-Pac region and BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market for JPY 810bln in JGBs, but with upside capped by resistance around the 151.00 level.</p>\r\n",
