        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities mixed, Treasuries up, crude down, dollar up.<br />* REAR-VIEW: US/Canada have not reached NAFTA deal; EU to increase auto tariffs if US does; EU and UK optimistic on Brexit trade deal by October; US Chicago PMI beat.<br />* NEXT WEEK: US Labor Day Holiday on Monday; BOC, RBA, Riksbank rate decisions, US ISM Manufacturing PMI, Speakers: RBA&rsquo;s Governor Lowe, BoE speak, ECB speak and Fed speak; US Durable Goods, US and Canadian Jobs Data.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Reports suggest no deal has been reached between US and Canada; President Trump will notify Congress to proceed with a Mexico-only trade deal that will replace NAFTA, sources reported late on Friday. Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister is set to deliver a news conference at 16.30 EST/2130 BST. Parties were expressing optimism that a deal can be reached, though according to a report in Canada&rsquo;s Globe, Canadian government officials are becoming pessimistic. This view was bolstered by reports in the Star which suggested that off-record, Trump told a reporter that he is not making any compromises in trade with Canada. Canada&rsquo;s Freeland continued to give media scrums, but was repeating the same messages, with a constructive tone. Elsewhere, Fox reported the US is said to see a revamped NAFTA deal within the next 3 months before Pena Nieto leaves office and the Trump administration said to possibly send a new trade deal notification to congress over the weekend of next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EU TRADE: </strong>European Commission President Juncker said the EU will increase auto tariffs if US does though he is hopeful an agreement with US President Trump will prevail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHINA: </strong>US officials said China is targeting experts in nuclear energy, supercomputing, nanotechnology, hybrid grains and green energy industries; the China&#39;s Foreign Ministry responded claiming the US allegations are &#39;complete nonsense&#39;. Additionally, Japanese Finance Minister Aso said Japan and China agree to stick to multinational trade system have based on free market rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>A senior EU source reported the UK and the EU negotiators are still a &lsquo;long way off&rsquo; with regards to a breakthrough in talks. At a conference with UK Brexit Secretary Raab, EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier said they have worked together on the future relationship between the UK and EU and discussed security of citizens and guaranteed rights; he reiterated the need of a backstop solution in withdrawal agreement on Irish border and stated the future relationship envisaged with UK is unprecedented. Raab also said he is &lsquo;stubbornly optimistic&rsquo; over a Brexit deal and added he is committed to sort out a deal by the October European Council on the 18th &ndash; 19th October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>Nowotny (Hawk) said the ECB should focus on getting deposit rate out of negative territory. ECB&rsquo;s Rehn noted markets are reading the ECB rate guidance correctly, echoing ECB President Draghi&#39;s comments at the press conference (26th July) where he stated money market expectations are very well aligned with the Governing Council&#39;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX 0.0% at 2901, NDX +0.2% at 7655, DJI -0.1% at 25959. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.7%, Materials -0.2%, Industrials +0.1%, Cons Discretionary +0.4%, Cons Staples +0.0%, Healthcare 0.0%, Financials -0.1%, Tech +0.1%, Telecoms -0.4%, Utilities -0.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Dan Loeb&rsquo;s Third Point LLC is looking for a list of nominees to challenge Campbell Soup&rsquo;s (CPB) board of directors, according to people familiar with the matter. It is reportedly unconvinced that the co. is exploring a sale of the entire group after it announced it is to sell its international refrigerated business unit on Thursday. Of note for Autonames (GM, F), European Commission President Juncker said the EU will increase auto tariffs in retaliation, if the US does, though he hopes his agreement with US President Trump will prevail, avoiding this scenario. Also, separately for Ford (F), a note from Morgan Stanley said the automaker&rsquo;s free cash flow may fall significantly in 2019. Walmart (WMT) were lower after Amazon (AMZN) announced it will soon sell food and drinks online in Mexico.&nbsp; Also, during hours The Information reported Alibaba (BABA) is to hold its plans to expand its US cloud business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Ulta Beauty&rsquo;s (ULTA) EPS beat Wall St expectations, and comparable sales came in at 6.5%. It announced it expects comparable sales and e-commerce sales to increase in Q3 between 7% and 8%, as a result ULTA outperformed among the SPX &amp; NDX. Lululemon (LULU) soared ~16% after a stellar earnings report which showed beats on top and bottom lines as well as raising its FY18 EPS &amp; revenue forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLED C HIGHER AT $/BBL; BRENT (V8) SETTLED C HIGHER AT $/BBL. </strong>WTI and Brent are on course to print a second successive week of gains, though end the week on a down-note, with trade concerns hitting risk sentiment, and outweighing bullish drivers regarding tightening supply concerns. Baker Hughes rig count was up by 4 this week, with oil rigs and gas rigs up by 2 rigs a piece. A Reuters survey expects OPEC oil output to rise to a 2018 high in August, despite supply losses in Iran; the survey also saw analysts cut their 2018 Brent and WTI price forecasts to 72.71 and 67.13 respectively. Elsewhere, sources reported that Saudi production rose to 10.424mln BPD in August, rising from 10.288mln previously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Net positive SOMA flows overshadowing bearish month end models, so far at least, as the index and broad Dollar end a topsy-turvy week on the up. In fact, the DXY is just a fraction off 95.000 again vs just above the big figure at the beginning of the week, as several USD/major pairs retest or set fresh highs, or lows where applicable, and close to the middle of a 95.315-94.430 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD, NZD: </strong>All down vs their US counterpart having enjoyed or endured contrasting fortunes over the course of the week. AUDUSD kicked off just over 0.7300 and topped out around 0.7360 before recoiling to current levels just above 0.7200 on multiple bearish factors. The catalyst was rather perverse on the face of it, as West Pac hiked its lending rates, but the AUD sank on even more neutral/dovish RBA policy implications based on the valid perception that if other commercial banks do the same to ease funding constraints then the consumer will also feel the squeeze. Much weaker than forecast Q2 capex data merely compounded the misery and heightened US-China tariff tensions were the final straw that also undermined the Kiwi on top of a sharp deterioration in NZ business sentiment to push NZDUSD from circa 0.6725 at one stage to 0.6625 at worst. Meanwhile, the Loonie saw upside to around 1.2880 on a combination of rebounding crude prices and revived hopes of a NAFTA deal after the US and Mexico finally shook hands on an agreement in principle, but Canadian GDP misses and conflicting views about whether Canada has offered agricultural concessions now appear likely to scupper prospects of an accord by the end of the day (week and month). USDCAD back up over 1.3000, but easing off 1.3070 peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>The single currency seems to have borne the brunt of the aforementioned SOMA-related Greenback demand, yet again, but also benign Eurozone inflation data this week and renewed concerns about Italy breaking or flouting the fiscal rules, with Fitch scheduled to review Rome&rsquo;s credit rating after hours today. Hence, EURUSD is currently closer to the bottom end of this week&rsquo;s 1.1590-1.1735 range, while EURGBP has retreated from circa 0.9075 to retest the 21 DMA (0.8972) having tripped some buy stops earlier for month end or fix requirements. Cable has lost grip of the 1.3000 handle, but only just and remains on course for a decent weekly gains (vs lows and an opening level in the low 1.2800 area) largely on considerably more conciliatory Brexit comments from EU&rsquo;s Barnier (declared a willingness to respect UK red lines and off an unprecedented arrangement) and the UK&rsquo;s Raab who is confident that a withdrawal bill can be drawn up by the end of October deadline, if not mid-November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Marked outperformance by the traditional safe-havens as EM angst and global risk factors ramped up, with USDJPY reversing from circa 111.80 towards 110.65, while the Franc got some additional impetus from a short squeeze (due to oversold/record negative positioning) and month end flows to rally almost 2 big figures vs the USD (0.9845 high/0.9650 low).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Widespread losses across the region even though official intervention was maintained, and in some cases ratcheted up to spectacular levels. Argentina&rsquo;s CB grabbed the headlines with a huge rate hike to 60% from 45%, but the Ars &lsquo;only&rsquo; derived relatively modest traction off 39.0000 record lows vs the USD. Conversely, the CBRT had more success (comparatively) via tweaks to withholding taxes as the Lira recovered from near 6.8000 lows vs the USD to sub-6.3800 before losing momentum again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP: </strong>Monday: US Labor Day Holiday, Japanese Nikkei Manufacturing PMI, China Caixin Manufacturing PMI, EZ Markit Manufacturing PMI (Final), Speakers: BoJ Governor Kuroda, ECB&rsquo;s Mersch and Fed&rsquo;s Evans.

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research expect the BOC to stand pat next week, but do see the central bank leaving the door open to further rate hikes, paving the way for a rate rise at the October meeting. BAML offers two reasons for its call: &ldquo;The first is to make sure the US Fed indeed hikes on 26 September, and the second is to gauge the impact on the economy of news on the trade front, as in the following days we will see if Canada joins a revamped trade agreement with the US and Mexico, goes for a bilateral trade deal with the US or faces a trade war with the current US administration.&rdquo; This week, commentary on the trade front has been positive, though little by way of new details have been revealed. The US has imposed a deadline of reaching a deal with Canada before the end of this week, else it will pursue a bilateral trade deal with Mexico. BAML&rsquo;s baseline scenario is that a trilateral deal will be reached soon, but says that the BOC can wait to get more information on trade before it tightens policy again, and says that the risk to our September call is for the BOC to hike. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19992/download\">CLICK HERE FOR OUR FULL WEEKLY CENTRAL BANK BRIEFING NOTE.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RBA PREVIEW: </strong>Analysts expect the RBA will hold its cash rate at 1.50% at its 4 September meeting. The expectation has been reinforced this week after Westpac raised SVR by 14bps, which has raised the spectre of other banks following suit. Analysts at Nomura argue that the move should not represent a tightening in financial conditions, instead, it will act to decrease any pressure on the RBA to consider any rate hike if the other banks follow.&rdquo; In terms of the statement, Westpac sees a repeat of the language that &ldquo;further progress in reducing unemployment and having inflation return to target is expected, although this progress is likely to be gradual.&rdquo; Westpac notes, however, that despite economic growth above trend over the last year, inflation within the target band, and the jobless rate at a six year low, uncertainties and challenges remain, &ldquo;notably around the consumer, weak wages growth, high household debt levels and housing, as prices ease a little following strong gains and as lending conditions tighten.&rdquo; The bank sees the RBA standing pat through 2018, 2019 and 2020. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19992/download\">CLICK HERE FOR OUR FULL WEEKLY CENTRAL BANK BRIEFING NOTE.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* RIKSBANK PREVIEW: </strong>The Riksbank is largely expected to stand pat on rates, with the repo rate at -0.50%. Analysts expect the central bank to concentrate on the weak underlying inflation trend. SEB notes &ldquo;Low underlying inflation will persuade the Riksbank to postpone key rate hikes until April 2019&rdquo;. That said, Nordea expects a minority of the Executive Board to attach a greater importance to the CPIF figure printing close to target for some time, adding &ldquo;stable inflation expectations provide scope for a rate hike in the near future&rdquo;. As a reminder, at the last meeting, Deputy Governor Ohlsson advocated for a rate hike, while he and Deputy Governor Floden both wanted a higher rate path. In terms of recent commentary, the central bank&rsquo;s First Deputy Governor af Jochnick stated inflation is on the way up and close to 2%, while adding the rate path shows probability for an October hike. The Swedish Central Bank rate decision is due at 08:30BST/03:30EDT on Thursday 6th September. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19992/download\">CLICK HERE FOR OUR FULL WEEKLY CENTRAL BANK BRIEFING NOTE.</a></p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Weekly FX Wrap: EM routs and trade rifts intensify, but some progress on NAFTA and Brexit",
        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Net positive SOMA flows overshadowing bearish month end models, so far at least, as the index and broad Dollar end a topsy-turvy week on the up. In fact, the DXY is just a fraction off 95.000 again vs just above the big figure at the beginning of the week, as several Usd/major pairs retest or set fresh highs, or lows where applicable, and close to the middle of a 95.315-94.430 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All down vs their US counterpart having enjoyed or endured contrasting fortunes over the course of the week. Aud/Usd kicked off just over 0.7300 and topped out around 0.7360 before recoiling to current levels just above 0.7200 on multiple bearish factors. The catalyst was rather perverse on the face of it, as West Pac hiked its lending rates, but the Aud sank on even more neutral/dovish RBA policy implications based on the valid perception that if other commercial banks do the same to ease funding constraints then the consumer will also feel the squeeze. Much weaker than forecast Q2 capex data merely compounded the misery and heightened US-China tariff tensions were the final straw that also undermined the Kiwi on top of a sharp deterioration in NZ business sentiment to push Nzd/Usd from circa 0.6725 at one stage to 0.6625 at worst. Meanwhile, the Loonie saw upside to around 1.2880 on a combination of rebounding crude prices and revived hopes of a NAFTA deal after the US and Mexico finally shook hands on an agreement in principle, but Canadian GDP misses and conflicting views about whether Canada has offered agricultural concessions now appear likely to scupper prospects of an accord by the end of the day (week and month). Usd/Cad back up over 1.3000, but easing off 1.3070 peaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency seems to have borne the brunt of the aforementioned SOMA-related Greenback demand, yet again, but also benign Eurozone inflation data this week and renewed concerns about Italy breaking or flouting the fiscal rules, with Fitch scheduled to review Rome&rsquo;s credit rating after hours today. Hence, Eur/Usd is currently closer to the bottom end of this week&rsquo;s 1.1590-1.1735 range, while Eur/Gbp has retreated from circa 0.9075 to retest the 21 DMA (0.8972) having tripped some buy stops earlier for month end or fix requirements. Cable has lost grip of the 1.3000 handle, but only just and remains on course for a decent weekly gains (vs lows and an opening level in the low 1.2800 area) largely on considerably more conciliatory Brexit comments from EU&rsquo;s Barnier (declared a willingness to respect UK red lines and off an unprecedented arrangement) and the UK&rsquo;s Raab who is confident that a withdrawal bill can be drawn up by the end of October deadline, if not mid-November.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marked outperformance by the traditional safe-havens as EM angst and global risk factors ramped up, with Usd/Jpy reversing from circa 111.80 towards 110.65, while the Franc got some additional impetus from a short squeeze (due to oversold/record negative positioning) and month end flows to rally almost 2 big figures vs the Usd (0.9845 high/0.9650 low).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Widespread losses across the region even though official intervention was maintained, and in some cases ratcheted up to spectacular levels. Argentina&rsquo;s CB grabbed the headlines with a huge rate hike to 60% from 45%, but the Ars &lsquo;only&rsquo; derived relatively modest traction off 39.0000 record lows vs the Usd. Conversely, the CBRT had more success (comparatively) via tweaks to withholding taxes as the Lira recovered from near 6.8000 lows vs the Usd to sub-6.3800 before losing momentum again.</p>\r\n",

This subsequently saw all US majors close in the red and both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Comp. snap their streak of record highs, although losses in most the Asia-Pac region have been stemmed as participants also digested a trifecta of encouraging China PMI data. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.5%) was lower as weakness in miners and profit taking in telecoms led the downside in Australia, while the Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was initially pressured by a firmer currency but then showed resilience and gradually rebounded throughout the session. Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) was also weighed by the fresh tariff fears although data helped plug losses including Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI which topped estimates and with Composite PMI higher than previous, while Hang Seng (-1.0%) was the worst performer as its largest weighted stock Tencent slumped over 5% at the open on government plans to control the amount of new online game releases. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher with demand supported by early safe-haven flows and with the BoJ also present in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs ranging from 1yr-10yr maturities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Manufacturing PMI (Jul) 51.3 vs. Exp. 51.0 (Prev. 51.2).

BoK stated the economy is to maintain growth momentum and rebound in consumption will continue but also commented that pace of investment will slow.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has no regrets appointing Powell as Fed chair and stated he is not being accommodated by the Fed in trade disputes but he is not sure the currency should be controlled by a politician. In addition, Trump stated that AG Sessions job is safe until at least the November elections and declared there will be no pay rises for public sector workers in 2019, while Trump also threatened to withdraw from WTO if it does not &quot;shape up&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump has once again threatened to withdraw from the WTO unless the organisation treats the US better. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that a trade agreement with Canada may come by Friday or within a period of time but it will occur, while Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland was said to be optimistic about NAFTA talks and commented that the both sides are showing constructive attitudes and have a lot of work to do in a short time. However, reports later noted that US &amp; Canada have not made progress yet on Chapter 9 issue in trade discussions and that Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland left talks with USTR after only minutes which will reconvene on Friday morning.

In terms of sectors, IT, materials and consumer discretionary names underperform. Material names are lower on base metal price action while consumer discretionary names are weighed on by autos following comments from EU&rsquo;s Juncker stating the EU will increase auto tariffs if the US does, hence denting sentiment in the sector. In terms of individual movers, Whitbread (+15.1%) opened higher by over 18% on reports the company proposed the sale of Costa to Coca Cola for GBP 3.9bln, while Whitbread&rsquo;s CEO added the deal offers a significant premium to anything that could be achieved from spinning off Costa alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a bit of stock-taking and upside extension when Gilts re-joined the fray, the 10 year EU benchmarks have retreated relatively sharply, with Bunds retesting 162.83 intraday lows (-15 ticks vs +15 ticks at best) and their UK equivalent down to a fresh Liffe base at 122.02 (-6 ticks vs +20 ticks at one stage). A firm rebound in BTPs has undermined core debt alongside cash bourses paring some losses, while for Eurex contracts there is also ongoing roll activity from Sep18 to Dec18 futures to contend with on top of pre-week/month end positioning. Back to Liffe, market contacts and a Ran client notes what looks like short position building in Dec18 Short Sterling puts with 10k lots of the 99.125 strike sold at 4 ticks following a sale at the same price 11k times on Thursday. Turning to US Treasuries, a firmer tone persists amidst marginal curve flattening, but price action could pick-up on SOMA and with a long holiday weekend ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD - The G10 outliers as the Franc continues to rally on a combination of safe-haven demand, short covering and currency portfolio rebalancing for the end of August, with Usd/Chf extending down through 0.9700 towards 0.9650 and not too far from key chart support at 0.9628 (50% Fib). Meanwhile, Eur/Chf is probing below 1.1300 and a US bank predicts 1.1200 before 2018 bows out, but the SNB may have other ideas and intervention has already been mentioned in some circles. Conversely, yesterday&rsquo;s Canadian GDP data misses are still weighing on the Loonie that is pivoting around 1.3000 vs its US counterpart ahead of PPI and raw material prices later, but more importantly waiting to see if a NAFTA deal can be tied up today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Also benefiting from month end-related demand and risk aversion amidst heightened US-EU/China import tariff tensions, with Usd/Jpy reversing further from near 112.00 highs to circa 110.70 and Jpy crosses strong bar Chf/Jpy for the aforementioned reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP - Both slightly firmer vs the Greenback and on a par with each other as the single currency meanders between 1.1690-60 and Cable circles 1.3000 ahead of more Brexit talks and less positive EU vibes about the 2 sides still being a long way from resolving the NI backstop. The cross has been volatile, albeit rangy around the 21 DMA at 0.8972, with stops and/or RHS orders for month end from 0.8975-80 pushing the pair up towards 0.8990 at one stage. Back to Eur/Usd, option expiries abound from 1.1675 (1.1 bn), through 1.1700-05 (1.7 bn) to 1.1720-25 (1.85 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD - No real sign of any lasting comfort from better than expected Chinese PMIs overnight, as the Aussie and Kiwi remain on track to end a torrid week with extended losses vs their US counterpart due to increased US-China and global trade threats. Aud/Usd has tumbled through 0.7250 and Nzd/Usd is struggling to hold 0.6650 as the cross rotates around 1.0900, but hefty option expiry interest may exert influence in Aud/Usd into the NY cut (almost 1.2 bn at 0.7250).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Interestingly, Turkey got a bit more purchase from latest measures to halt Lira losses via prolonging tax exemptions on wealth repatriation by 6 months, increasing withholding tax on up to 1 year foreign currency deposits and setting taxes on Try deposits of up to 1 year at 0% than Argentina with its eye-catching (watering) 1500 bp rate hike on Thursday. Indeed, Usd/Try reversed sharply from just over 6.7900 to sub-6.3800 before settling around 6.5000 amidst more verbal intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures are softer on the day while the former is still holding onto the USD 70/bbl handle heading into the end of the month. Next month will be interesting as the OPEC and non-OPEC technical committee meet on 11th to potentially discuss a production strategy, while the JMMC are to meet in Algeria on the 23rd. Elsewhere, gold is benefitting from the softer dollar while copper lags on reports the US may impose tariffs on USD 200bln worth of Chinese goods as soon as next week. Separately, the Shanghai Futures Exchange are to launch copper options on September 21st.</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, Eur/Chf is probing below 1.1300 and a US bank predicts 1.1200 before 2018 bows out, but the SNB may have other ideas and intervention has already been mentioned in some circles. Conversely, yesterday&rsquo;s Canadian GDP data misses are still weighing on the Loonie that is pivoting around 1.3000 vs its US counterpart ahead of PPI and raw material prices later, but more importantly waiting to see if a NAFTA deal can be tied up today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also benefiting from month end-related demand and risk aversion amidst heightened US-EU/China import tariff tensions, with Usd/Jpy reversing further from near 112.00 highs to circa 110.70 and Jpy crosses strong bar Chf/Jpy for the aforementioned reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both slightly firmer vs the Greenback and on a par with each other as the single currency meanders between 1.1690-60 and Cable circles 1.3000 ahead of more Brexit talks and less positive EU vibes about the 2 sides still being a long way from resolving the NI backstop. The cross has been volatile, albeit rangy around the 21 DMA at 0.8972, with stops and/or RHS orders for month end from 0.8975-80 pushing the pair up towards 0.8990 at one stage. Back to Eur/Usd, option expiries abound from 1.1675 (1.1 bn), through 1.1700-05 (1.7 bn) to 1.1720-25 (1.85 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No real sign of any lasting comfort from better than expected Chinese PMIs overnight, as the Aussie and Kiwi remain on track to end a torrid week with extended losses vs their US counterpart due to increased US-China and global trade threats. Aud/Usd has tumbled through 0.7250 and Nzd/Usd is struggling to hold 0.6650 as the cross rotates around 1.0900, but hefty option expiry interest may exert influence in Aud/Usd into the NY cut (almost 1.2 bn at 0.7250).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, Turkey got a bit more purchase from latest measures to halt Lira losses via prolonging tax exemptions on wealth repatriation by 6 months, increasing withholding tax on up to 1 year foreign currency deposits and setting taxes on Try deposits of up to 1 year at 0% than Argentina with its eye-catching (watering) 1500 bp rate hike on Thursday. Indeed, Usd/Try reversed sharply from just over 6.7900 to sub-6.3800 before settling around 6.5000 amidst more verbal intervention.</p>\r\n",

In related news, US President Trump later stated that China is trying to devalue its currency and the US is studying whether to label China as a currency manipulator.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was relatively flat after the greenback&rsquo;s recent mixed performance against its major counterparts in which EUR/USD languished below 1.1700 and GBP/USD flatlined near 3-week highs at the 1.3000 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped under 111.00 to the downside on safe-haven flows, CAD weakened past 1.3000 against the greenback amid a lack of progress in trade discussions and AUD was slightly weighed by a cautious tone from the RBA which noted high debt levels could make future policy decisions difficult. EM currencies were the biggest movers and saw renewed selling pressure triggered by the ARS after the Argentinian Central Bank&rsquo;s rate hike to 60% from 45% and FX market intervention did little to halt the collapse of the currency, while TRY also depreciated as much as 2% in early trade before paring the move amid new stabilisaiton measures and IDR fell to its lowest in 2 decades which prompted further intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA said high debt levels could make future policy decisions difficult and could also make the economy less resilient to shocks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turkey prolonged its tax exemption on wealth repatriation by 6 months, while Turkey also increased the withholding tax level on up to 1yr foreign currency deposits and set the withholding tax on TRY deposits of up to 1yr at 0%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Argentina Treasury Minister Dujovne is planning to travel to Washington DC on Monday to meet with the IMF and the Treasury Ministry is to announce a set of measures to combat financial crisis on Monday, while Argentina&#39;s Central Bank was also said to push for further FX intervention. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed with initial softness in WTI crude futures pared as prices found support at the recently reclaimed USD 70/bbl level. Elsewhere, gold prices rose back above USD 1200/oz with the precious metal underpinned by its safe-haven status, while copper lagged but with downside limited as the encouraging Chinese PMI data attempted to counterbalance the fresh tariff concerns.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bid in Treasuries in the pre-market was attributed to worries around the looming deadline for the US and Canada to reach a trade deal by COB on Friday; with that said, the bid was modest, with Treasury yields down by between 1-2bps, amid constructive commentary from the Canadian foreign minister. In later trade, the TPLEX found further buyers on reports that Trump could announce $200bln of tariffs on China early next week, though the decision was not final. Even so, yields were only lower by 2-3bps by settlement. As is the norm, curve spreads narrowed, with 2s10s falling to 20.1bps. US 10-year T-notes settled 5+ ticks higher at 120-08+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has no regrets appointing Powell as Fed chair and stated he is not being accommodated by the Fed in trade disputes but he is not sure the currency should be controlled by a politician. In addition, Trump stated that AG Sessions job is safe until at least the November elections and declared there will be no pay rises for public sector workers in 2019, while Trump also threatened to withdraw from WTO if it does not &quot;shape up&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump has once again threatened to withdraw from the WTO unless the organisation treats the US better. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that a trade agreement with Canada may come by Friday or within a period of time but it will occur, while Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland was said to be optimistic about NAFTA talks and commented that the both sides are showing constructive attitudes and have a lot of work to do in a short time. However, reports later noted that US &amp; Canada have not made progress yet on Chapter 9 issue in trade discussions and that Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland left talks with USTR after only minutes which will reconvene on Friday morning.

        "content": "<p>Asian equity markets traded mostly lower with sentiment weighed as trade war fears were reignited by reports US President Trump is said to back tariffs on an additional USD 200bln of Chinese goods as early as next week. This subsequently saw all US majors close in the red and both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Comp. snap their streak of record highs, although losses in most the Asia-Pac region have been stemmed as participants also digested a trifecta of encouraging China PMI data. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.4%) was lower as weakness in miners and profit taking in telecoms led the downside in Australia, while the Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) was initially pressured by a firmer currency but then showed resilience and gradually rebounded throughout the session. Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) was also weighed by the fresh tariff fears although data helped plug losses including Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI which topped estimates and with Composite PMI higher than previous, while Hang Seng (-0.9%) was the worst performer as its largest weighted stock Tencent slumped over 5% at the open on government plans to control the amount of new online game releases. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally higher with demand supported by early safe-haven flows and with the BoJ also present in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs ranging from 1yr-10yr maturities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade lower across the board with sentiment weighed as trade war fears were reignited by reports US President Trump is said to back tariffs on an additional USD 200bln of Chinese goods as early as next week. This subsequently saw all US majors close in the red and both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Comp. snap their streak of record highs, although losses in most the Asia-Pac region have been stemmed as participants digest a trifecta of encouraging Chinese PMI data. Nonetheless, ASX 200 (-0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) opened negative with weakness in miners and profit taking in telecoms leading the downside in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark is pressured by a firmer currency. Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) is also weighed by the fresh tariff fears although data has helped plug losses including Chinese Official Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing PMI which topped estimates and with Composite PMI higher than previous, while Hang Seng (-1.2%) is the worst performer as its largest weighted stock Tencent slumped over 5% at the open on government plans to control the amount of new online game releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY is relatively flat after the greenback&rsquo;s recent mixed performance against its major counterparts with EUR/USD languishing below 1.1700 and with GBP/USD flatlining near 3-week highs at the 1.3000 handle. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped under 111.00 to the downside amid the safe-haven flows, CAD weakened past 1.3000 against the greenback amid a lack of progress in trade discussions and AUD was slightly weighed by a cautious tone from the RBA which noted high debt levels could make future policy decisions difficult. EM currencies saw renewed selling pressure triggered by the ARS as the Argentinian Central Bank&rsquo;s rate hike to 60% from 45% and FX market intervention did little to halt the collapse of the currency, while TRY also depreciated as much as 2% and IDR fell to its lowest in 2 decades which prompted further intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally higher with demand supported by safe-haven flows and with the BoJ also present in the market for nearly JPY 1tln of JGBs ranging from 1yr-10yr maturities. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
