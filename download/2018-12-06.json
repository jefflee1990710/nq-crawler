Activision Blizzard (ATVI) traded higher following an upgrade at JPMorgan; competitors Take-Two (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) also outperformed. Trade sensitive stocks such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) opened lower as trade truce concerns rose following the arrest of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO. A drop in crude prices following scepticism on an adequate OPEC cut weighed down oil names (XOM, CVX, COP, KMI, EOG, OXY).

The meeting culminated in no deal announcement, and delegates are now expecting an accord to come tomorrow though focus was also placed on contrasting comments from Al Falih who first said all options are on the table, including no deal, and then followed this up by stating he is not confident of an agreement tomorrow. Russia&rsquo;s role in the agreement remains a source of speculation with prices hampered by comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak suggesting that it is difficult for Russia to cut output quickly in Winter. Furthermore, questions also remain over who might not participate in any output cut with some suggesting that Libya and Venezuela are to be exempt from the suggested 1mln BPD cut, with Iran still a sticking point. This comes as Iran continues to hold a tough stance in negotiations by stating that they will not be a part of any deal to reduce output until sanctions are removed. With regards to a timeframe, delegates have suggested the cuts will last 6 months while the Oman Oil Minister jas suggested that they could last anywhere between 3 months, 6 months or a year. Elsewhere, weekly crude inventories showed a draw of 7.323mln which was significantly larger than the expected draw of 942k; despite the large drop, oil prices only ticked mildly higher as the complex remained highly responsive to OPEC developments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> China&#39;s Commerce Ministry appeared very confident on Thursday of reaching a trade agreement with the US within the 90-day period, noting the two sides have found consensus on agriculture, energy and cars with the new agreements to be implemented immediately. The Ministry highlighted that the ultimate goal in US-China negotiations is to remove all tariffs and that trade talks with the US are not a give and take situation. On the US side, White House National Security Advisor Bolton stated that the economic changes the US is seeking in China - via its trade talks - may impact their political structure though that is not the aim. In related comments, Chinese Premier Li said that China are to further protect intellectual property rights. Late reports by CNN suggested that the US could use Huawei&#39;s CEO arrest as leverage to US-China talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADP PAYROLLS: </strong>The ADP reported 179k payrolls were added to the US economy in November, short of the 195k the Street was looking for. Crucially, Moody&rsquo;s chief economist stated that while the report was strong, job growth has likely peaked: &ldquo;This month&rsquo;s report is free of significant weather effects and suggests slowing underlying job creation. With very tight labour markets, and record unfilled positions, businesses will have an increasingly tough time adding to payrolls.&rdquo; Others noted that the data followed months of above-trend prints, so may not signal any meaningful shift in job growth. Additionally, Pantheon Macroeconomics says it looks for an official NFP reading above the ADP print since the BLS data will include people returning to work following hurricanes. &ldquo;ADP isn&rsquo;t directly affected by hurricanes because it counts names on payroll lists, while the BLS only counts people who were paid during the survey period, so hourly-paid part-timers can drop off the numbers after storms, and then return the following month,&rdquo; Pantheon said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DURABLES</strong> posted the largest decline since July 2017, falling 4.3% in October and dragged lower by weakness in the volatile aircraft component; other details were mixed with core durables coming in flat following a two consecutive months decline. Analysts at Oxford Economics note that overall the report confirms that &ldquo;business investment momentum continues to cool, with the trends slowing for both core orders and shipments to 3.4% y/y and 4.3% y/y, respectively&rdquo;; they anticipate business investment to grow at around 3.3% annualised in Q4 as their Q4 GDP tracker stands at 2.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ISM NON-MANUFACTURING INDEX </strong>rose to 60.7 in November above the expected 59.0 and up from October&rsquo;s 60.3 print. Wells Fargo Securities highlights this as the third consecutive reading over 60, a first in the survey&rsquo;s 21-year history. Breaking down the index, business activity came in at 65.2, reversing the fall in October&rsquo;s print; new orders and backlog of orders also rose; employment index fell to 58.4. Comments showed that survey participants raised trade issues and finding skilled labour as key challenges, but overall another strong survey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Neutral) believes rates are a &quot;little bit below&quot; neutral while noting the neutral rate is not precise. He does not think inflation is not running away from them and he warned if there is a slowdown in global growth, then the US will not be immune; he highlighted that the longer end yield curve is suggesting a slower growth outlook. Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish) said that the Fed is within shouting distance from neutral rate,</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>Chatter over the budget continued on Thursday as disagreements over the budget target emerged within the coalition government; sources suggested that the League party does not want a 2019 deficit below 2.2% of GDP while the 5-Star are willing to consider a 2.1% deficit/GDP target, but nothing lower. PM Conte was said to be working to lower the budget deficit target to 1.9%-2.0%. as well as 2020 and 2021 targets and stressed that a solution with EU must be found; he said to be working on details of a new meeting with EU&rsquo;s Juncker. Nonetheless positivity EU&#39;s Moscovici said they are on the correct path with Italy and stated they must continue to make progress. In later trade, Italy&#39;s government called for a confidence vote in Parliament&#39;s lower house on the 2019 budget law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>BoC&#39;s Poloz stated that rates will need to rise, and the pace will remain data dependent; he noted that data after October&#39;s monetary policy report have been disappointing and economy has less momentum going into Q4. He said that the neutral rate is mostly driven by international developments though he will not really know where neutral is until they are there. He highlighted that that Governing Council&#39;s discussion focused a lot on oil since prices fell well below MPR projections and noted that demand could be hit by moderating global growth, trade tensions. He believes that falling oil prices will cause a painful adjustment for Western Canada, effecting the wider Canadian economy; he is not dismissing the warning that the flattening yield curve is giving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;SPX -0.15% at 2696, NDX +0.64% at 6839, DJI -0.31% at 24948. SECTORS: </strong>Energy -1.78%, Materials -1.37%, Industrials -0.55%, Cons Discretionary +0.61%, Cons Staples -0.10%, Healthcare -0.32%, Financials -1.44%, Tech +0.23%, Telecoms +1.04%, Utilities -0.09%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>FAANG (FB, AAPL, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL) stocks were under pressure in early trade but later rebounded helping pare back some of the losses. Hewlett Packard (HPE) outperformed after beating EPS and revenue estimates. L Brands (LB) and Costco (COST) opened higher on the back of strong sales figures. A fall in Treasury yields helped push higher homebuilders (PHM, LEN, WY, DHI), but on the flipside dragged heavily on the financial sector (C, BAC, WFC, JPM, MS, SCHW). Activision Blizzard (ATVI) traded higher following an upgrade at JPMorgan; competitors Take-Two (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) also outperformed. Trade sensitive stocks such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) opened lower as trade truce concerns rose following the arrest of Huawei&rsquo;s CFO. A drop in crude prices following scepticism on an adequate OPEC cut weighed down oil names (XOM, CVX, COP, KMI, EOG, OXY).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 1.40 LOWER AT USD 51.49/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 1.50 LOWER AT USD 60.06/BBL.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 1.1+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-14+.&nbsp;</strong>Treasuries caught a bid on Thursday amid deteriorating risk sentiment, market volatility and as data begun to signal some negativity in the US economy. The 10yr yield hit a 3-month low in the session while yields overall were higher by c.5bps at settlement; the move was led by the front end encouraged by a block trade as well as bull-flattens in Eur/Usd. Next week, the US Treasury will sell USD 38bln in 3-year notes, USD 24bln in 10-year notes, USD 16bln in 30-year bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD:</strong> The Greenback has been undermined by an almost clean sweep of sub-forecast US macro updates, including ADP and weekly claims ahead of Friday&rsquo;s NFP, which compounded more cautious talk from the Fed with Kaplan expressing concern about the knock-on effect of slower global growth. This also depressed Treasury yields and kept curve spreads close to recent flat or even inverted levels, with the DXY slipping back below 97.000 and slightly further than of late towards 96.500 even though the Buck remained firm against the riskier/high beta rivals (major and EM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* G10: </strong>Gbp and Eur aside, a clear pattern and divide is still evident between safer-havens and risk or commodity currencies that are getting swamped and consumed by the latest sell-off in oil prices amidst possibly more confusion and politicking than usual from OPEC. The Jpy and Chf are consequently in demand with gains through 112.50 and almost to 0.9900 vs the Usd respectively, while the Aud, Cad and Nzd all lag, albeit off worst levels due to the aforementioned retracement in their US counterpart. Indeed, Aud/Usd is back above 0.7200 having fallen to circa 0.7195 on the back of dovish/cautious sounding rhetoric from RBA&rsquo;s Debelle, while the Loonie pared some losses from 1.3440+ to just over 1.3400 at one stage after BoC&rsquo;s Poloz underscored further rate hikes to reach the inflation target, but with even more data contingency having largely shrugged off a bigger than expected Canadian trade deficit. Back down under, the Kiwi continues to benefit at the expense of its antipodean peer (or vice-versa), to a degree, as Aud/Nzd breached 1.0500 and registered a new 2018 base near 0.0480 and Nzd/Usd hovered not far from 0.6800. Elsewhere, the Sek and Nok suffered from the risk-off mood, with the latter also weighed by the collapse in crude and perhaps bearish F-loan flows, but Cable and Eur/Usd both rebounded off or just ahead of big figures (1.2700 and 1.1300) to retest nearest round numbers above, mainly on the Usd pull-back and even though Brexit and the Italian budget situations remain up in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Not much respite for regional currencies as safe-haven positioning intensified, as the Zar weakened further alongside the Rub, Try and Brl, although the Mxn managed to pare some losses to bounce off lows and test sub-20.5000 levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>US Nonfarm Payrolls (November 2018). US employment situation report to be released at 1330 GMT/0830 EST on 7 December 2018. Consensus view +200k payrolls; AHE seen unchanged at 3.1% YY; jobless rate seen unchanged at 3.7%. Data takes more importance with FOMC policy data-dependent; November&rsquo;s data will be &lsquo;clean&rsquo; of weather effects. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20719/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

        "analysis_details": "<p>Crude prices collapsed as the 175th OPEC meeting begun, with OPEC delegates suggesting that OPEC+ could cut just 1mln BPD if Russia agrees to cut 150k BPD, a sentiment echoed by KSA&rsquo;s Energy Minister and source reports later in the day. The meeting culminated in no deal announcement, and delegates are now expecting an accord to come tomorrow though focus was also placed on contrasting comments from Al Falih who first said all options are on the table, including no deal, and then followed this up by stating he is not confident of an agreement tomorrow. Russia&rsquo;s role in the agreement remains a source of speculation with prices hampered by comments from Russian Energy Minister Novak suggesting that it is difficult for Russia to cut output quickly in Winter. Furthermore, questions also remain over who might not participate in any output cut with some suggesting that Libya and Venezuela are to be exempt from the suggested 1mln BPD cut, with Iran still a sticking point. This comes as Iran continues to hold a tough stance in negotiations by stating that they will not be a part of any deal to reduce output until sanctions are removed. With regards to a timeframe, delegates have suggested the cuts will last 6 months while the Oman Oil Minister jas suggested that they could last for either 3 months, 6 months or a year. Elsewhere, weekly crude inventories showed a draw of 7.323mln which was significantly larger than the expected draw of 942k; despite the large drop, oil prices only ticked mildly higher as the complex remained highly responsive to OPEC developments.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has been undermined by an almost clean sweep of sub-forecast US macro updates, including ADP and weekly claims ahead of Friday&rsquo;s NFP, which compounded more cautious talk from the Fed with Kaplan expressing concern about the knock-on effect of slower global growth. This also depressed Treasury yields and kept curve spreads close to recent flat or even inverted levels, with the DXY slipping back below 97.000 and slightly further than of late towards 96.500 even though the Buck remained firm against the riskier/high beta rivals (major and EM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G10 &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gbp and Eur aside, a clear pattern and divide is still evident between safer-havens and risk or commodity currencies that are getting swamped and consumed by the latest sell-off in oil prices amidst possibly more confusion and politicking than usual from OPEC. The Jpy and Chf are consequently in demand with gains through 112.50 and almost to 0.9900 vs the Usd respectively, while the Aud, Cad and Nzd all lag, albeit off worst levels due to the aforementioned retracement in their US counterpart. Indeed, Aud/Usd is back above 0.7200 having fallen to circa 0.7195 on the back of dovish/cautious sounding rhetoric from RBA&rsquo;s Debelle, while the Loonie pared some losses from 1.3440+ to just over 1.3400 at one stage after BoC&rsquo;s Poloz underscored further rate hikes to reach the inflation target, but with even more data contingency having largely shrugged off a bigger than expected Canadian trade deficit. Back down under, the Kiwi continues to benefit at the expense of its antipodean peer (or vice-versa), to a degree, as Aud/Nzd breached 1.0500 and registered a new 2018 base near 0.0480 and Nzd/Usd hovered not far from 0.6800. Elsewhere, the Sek and Nok suffered from the risk-off mood, with the latter also weighed by the collapse in crude and perhaps bearish F-loan flows, but Cable and Eur/Usd both rebounded off or just ahead of big figures (1.2700 and 1.1300) to retest nearest round numbers above, mainly on the Usd pull-back and even though Brexit and the Italian budget situations remain up in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much respite for regional currencies as safe-haven positioning intensified, as the Zar weakened further alongside the Rub, Try and Brl, although the Mxn managed to pare some losses to bounce off lows and test sub-20.5000 levels.</p>\r\n",

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is being pushed by cabinet members to postpone next week&#39;s Parliament vote on Brexit amid worries she is facing a loss so disastrous it could collapse the government. Instead, cabinet members believe that the PM should devote more time to selling the deal. (Times) Furthermore, reports have suggested that PM May has sent her Chief Whip to try find a way forward with the ERG by offering a potential Parliamentary &lsquo;lock&rsquo; which would require lawmakers to give their consent before some of the more controversial parts of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU came into effect. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is ready to offer PM May a lifeline of extending Article 50 if her deal is rejected by Parliament next week, according to sources.

Adding that new budget estimates will be ready today. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian League Party sources suggest the party doesn&#39;t want a 2019 deficit below 2.2% of GDP, and 5-Star sources say they are willing to consider a 2.1% deficit/GDP target, but nothing lower. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities (Eurostoxx -2.0%) have taken the lead from US futures and Asia-Pac trade overnight with US-Chinese trade concerns reignited by news that Canada arrested Huawei&rsquo;s CFO at the request of US authorities for alleged violations of sanctions against Iran. This prompted demands by China&rsquo;s Embassy for an immediate release of the executive, which subsequently weighed heavily on US equity futures. Despite commentary from China ahead of the open stating that their ultimate goal in US-China negotiations is to remove all tariffs, overnight developments have weighed heavily on sentiment in Europe thus far. The follow-through of events overnight has placed weight on IT names with STMicroelectronics (a supplier to Huawei) lower by -4.8% with losses also observed in Dialog Semiconductor (-2.6%) and Infineon (-3.3%) among others . Elsewhere, energy names underperform amid initial comments from the OPEC ministers in Vienna, signalling a potential cut in the low end of the expected range. In turn, European Oil and Gas Index fell 3.4% in-fitting with price action in the oil complex (BP -4.3%, Total -2.5%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/USD/CHF - All beneficiaries of safe-haven positioning/demand, as the global stock rout continues and intensifies, but to varying degrees with Usd/Jpy retreating below 113.00 while Usd/Chf holds near parity and the DXY remains around 97.000 amidst heavy losses in certain G10 counterparts. However, some hefty and layered option expiries in Usd/Jpy could keep that pair in check, with 1.6 bn rolling off between 112.75-80 and a similar amount sitting at 112.95-113.00, ahead of more 1+ bn maturities above the figure up to 113.75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD - The non-US Dollars have extended declines vs the Greenback and underperformance against other majors, as bearish independent impulses exacerbate the negative impact of broader risk aversion. Aud/Usd is now testing 0.7200 bids and psychological support following dovish commentary from RBA&rsquo;s Debelle in wake of this week&rsquo;s disappointing GDP data, with rate cuts back on the agenda if the economy slows further and the baseline scenario of the next policy move being a hike does not pan out. By the same token, and with the added pressure of collapsing crude prices amidst talk of no more than 1 mn output cuts from OPEC+, the Loonie has continued its post-BoC plunge to circa 1.3440, while the Kiwi has slipped below 0.6900 towards 0.6850, but is deriving underlying support from the greater demise in the Aud again, as the cross retreats through 1.0500 and to a fresh ytd low around 1.0480.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - The Pound and single currency are both holding up reasonably well given the increasingly risk-off environment, not to mention ongoing Brexit and Italian budget tension, as Cable maintains 1.2700+ status and Eur/Usd stays above 1.1300. Note, mega option expiries in close proximity from 1.1295-1.1300, 113.50-60 to 1.1380 (1.65 bn, 1.7 bn and circa 1.4 bn respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Almost a blanket sea of red and heavy losses vs the Usd, especially for the Rub, Zar and Yuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risk-off tone has been offered additional pressure by OPEC+ headlines and Saudi quoting a 1.3mln BPD cut as excessive; this has given Bunds impetus to print a marginal new Mar. contract high at 163.35, with the German benchmark now trading around the 163.30 handle and 163.52/55 trend resistance up next. BTPs saw a kneejerk dip to 123.53 off the back of League and 5-star source reports that the far-right party are holding out for a 2.2% deficit/GDP target, but pared back the majority of this move to revert to the 123.80 area. Traders are now looking to tonight&rsquo;s finalised budget details as advised by Deputy PM Salvini ahead of the Lower House and Senate votes tomorrow and Monday with market participants noting a fresh downside buyer via BTP options with a max pay-out should 10-year yields hit ~3.65%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts are still regaining some composure (+23 ticks) on risk sentiment, but still lag Bunds, after a couple of days of Brexit-driven beatings, with the 10-year eking out a high print of 123.31 after the UK&rsquo;s 2049 auction that saw yields fall markedly from 1.826% to 1.0909%, and b/c climb from 1.76 to 2.40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US 10-year futures are marginally up with yet more bull flattening as traders return to their desks to a rocky market after H. W. Bush&rsquo;s memorial and confirm to the risk-off tone, with investors looking for further direction from multiple tier 1 data releases and multiple Fed speakers rounded of by Chair Powell at the end of the EU day and NFP tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brent (-4.3%) and WTI (-4.2%) have continued to drift lower as the 175th OPEC meeting begins, with initial remarks from OPEC delegates suggesting that OPEC+ could only cut 1mln BPD if Russia agrees to cut 150k BPD, adding they would be willing to cut over 1.3mln BPD if Russia cuts 250k BPD. Sources thereafter went on to state that any cut is unlikely to be over 1.4mln BPD. Russia&rsquo;s role in the agreement continues to remain a source of speculation with prices hampered by comments from the Russian Energy Minister Novak suggesting that it is difficult for Russia to cut output quickly in Winter. WTI and Brent crude futures were then dragged lower once again after the Saudi Energy Minister Al-Falih says there is no agreement yet to cut but all options are on the table, including a no deal. Al-Falih then added that a 1mln BPD cut will be enough for OPEC+, a comment which appeared to add to the downside in energy markets with the level touted not well received by the market, particularly after he then went on to state that the KSA are content with the current oil price. Furthermore, questions also remain over who might not participate in any output cut with NOC&#39;s Sanallah contradicting comments from the Oman oil minister overnight after stating that Libya is hoping for an exemption from the OPEC cuts. Additionally, Iran continues to hold a tough stance in negotiations by stating that they will not be a part of any deal to reduce output until sanctions are removed. Note, this week&rsquo;s DoE report will be released today due to yesterday&rsquo;s market closure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold is trading flat within a tight USD 5/oz range, with spot palladium trading at a premium to gold for the first time in 16 years; as prices hit record levels of USD 1246.50 in the previous session. Separately, China has reportedly asked steel mills in the province of Tangshan to being implementing winter curbs due to a reduction in air quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a full rundown of OPEC commentary please see the relevant stories on our headline feed by using the &lsquo;Commodities&rsquo; filter.</p>\r\n",

However, some hefty and layered option expiries in Usd/Jpy could keep that pair in check, with 1.6 bn rolling off between 112.75-80 and a similar amount sitting at 112.95-113.00, ahead of more 1+ bn maturities above the figure up to 113.75.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/NZD &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The non-US Dollars have extended declines vs the Greenback and underperformance against other majors, as bearish independent impulses exacerbate the negative impact of broader risk aversion. Aud/Usd is now testing 0.7200 bids and psychological support following dovish commentary from RBA&rsquo;s Debelle in wake of this week&rsquo;s disappointing GDP data, with rate cuts back on the agenda if the economy slows further and the baseline scenario of the next policy move being a hike does not pan out. By the same token, and with the added pressure of collapsing crude prices amidst talk of no more than 1 mn output cuts from OPEC+, the Loonie has continued its post-BoC plunge to circa 1.3440, while the Kiwi has slipped below 0.6900 towards 0.6850, but is deriving underlying support from the greater demise in the Aud again, as the cross retreats through 1.0500 and to a fresh ytd low around 1.0480.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound and single currency are both holding up reasonably well given the increasingly risk-off environment, not to mention ongoing Brexit and Italian budget tension, as Cable maintains 1.2700+ status and Eur/Usd stays above 1.1300. Note, mega option expiries in close proximity from 1.1295-1.1300, 113.50-60 to 1.1380 (1.65 bn, 1.7 bn and circa 1.4 bn respectively).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost a blanket sea of red and heavy losses vs the Usd, especially for the Rub, Zar and Yuan.</p>\r\n",

However, Gilts are still lagging Bunds within an early Liffe band of 123.03-19 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 122.94 settlement price, while the 3 month strip is 1.5 ticks firmer beyond Mar20 and narrowly mixed at the front end. Turning to Thursday&rsquo;s domestic docket, DMO issuance looks set to be pivotal in the absence of any scheduled data, but BoE&rsquo;s Broadbent and/or Ramsden could also provide some interest and it goes without saying that Brexit headlines, reports and commentary will continue to be monitored as the clock ticks down to December 11. Note, the meaningful vote comes just a day after the official ECJ ruling on Article 50, which looks a formality given the Court&rsquo;s top legal adviser already giving his nod of approval for unilateral revocation.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, the intention is to settle all outstanding trade issues within the set 90 day negotiating period, and flagging risk sentiment has also been boosted by headlines suggesting more progress on the Italian budget front to meet EU demands along with the latest from OPEC suggesting a 1-1.4 mn bpd cut in crude output depending on Russia. Hence, the core Eurozone bond has faded after an early attempt to retest Wednesday&rsquo;s Eurex session and contract peak (163.34) at 163.29 from 163.14 initially and the 162.85 previous close, to 162.94 so far. Ahead, no additional Eurozone data after considerably firmer than forecast German factory orders, but a packed US agenda due to yesterday&rsquo;s holiday and several ECB speakers scheduled, plus a slug of French supply.</p>\r\n",

Instead, cabinet members believe that the PM should devote more time to selling the deal. (Times) Furthermore, reports have suggested that PM May has sent her Chief Whip to try find a way forward with the ERG by offering a potential Parliamentary &lsquo;lock&rsquo; which would require lawmakers to give their consent before some of the more controversial parts of the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU came into effect.

Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were pressured as the risk averse tone spurred flows into safe-haven JPY, while antipodeans softened on the downbeat sentiment and pull back in oil prices. CAD also extended on the losses seen from the dovish tone at the BoC policy announcement, with Canada stuck between a rock and a hard place on its next actions regarding the Huawei CFO arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Retail Sales (Oct) M/M 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.2% (Prev. 0.2%).

Elsewhere, gold prices remained afloat amid an uneventful greenback and mild safe-haven support, while copper prices further deteriorated overnight with demand sapped by the risk averse tone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC discussed a cut between 800k-900k BPD and will continue to discuss levels on Thursday, while delegates are said to be split on which month will be used for the baseline month. Furthermore, reports noted that Iraq is agreeable to joining the cuts, while the Oman OPEC official said Nigeria and Libya agreed not to be exempt from oil cut agreement. (Argus/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC delegate said some nations see a cut of under 1mln BPD as adequate and that today&rsquo;s meeting may not agree specific numbers, while the delegate added that OPEC needs to factor in the impact of Canada&rsquo;s supply reduction last week, as well as potential reductions from Venezuela and Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh said Iran is seeking exemption from OPEC decision and that a suitable oil price for Iran is between USD 60-70/bbl. Furthermore, Zanganeh added that JMMC acted outside of mandate during past year and that Iran doesn&#39;t want to join JMMC, while there were separate reports that Russia calculates a return to 2016 oil quotas could result in a cut of 1.2mln bpd.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are lower across the board and are on course for a 3rd consecutive day of losses with sentiment dampened after the US market closure and reports that Canada arrested Huawei&rsquo;s CFO at the request of US authorities. This prompted demands by China&rsquo;s Embassy for an immediate release of the executive who faces extradition to the US on allegations she violated US sanctions against Iran, and subsequently contributed to the pressure for US equity futures in which the Emini S&amp;P dropped by over 60 points and DJIA futures were down by more than 500 points shortly after the reopen, which forced the CME to intervene to prevent a harder drop. As such, ASX 200 (-0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (-1.9%) are weaker with the latter slumping on detrimental currency flows, while Hang Seng (-2.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.2%) are also negative with the Hong Kong benchmark underperforming amid losses across all its components. Furthermore, the PBoC announcement of a 1-yr Medium-term Lending Facility failed to support the overall picture in China, with the MLF operation at a reduced amount of CNY 187.5bln vs. Prev. CNY 403.5bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY lacks firm direction following the US market closure and is stuck near the 97.00 level as its counterparts across the pond trade uneventful with EUR/USD and GBP/USD range-bound throughout the session. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were pressured as the risk averse tone spurred flows into safe-haven JPY, while commodity linked currencies are softer on the downbeat sentiment and pull back in oil prices. In addition, CAD extends on the losses seen from the dovish tone at the BoC policy announcement with Canada stuck between a rock and a hard place on its next actions regarding the Huawei CFO arrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher amid a continuation in the recent declines across yields and with safe-haven demand also underpinned by the weakness across equities.</p>\r\n",
