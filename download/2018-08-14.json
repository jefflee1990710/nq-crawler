In terms of earnings, Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) surged following a beat on both top and bottom line, as well as announcing a new USD 600mln share repurchase programme. Tapestry (TPR) also soared after a strong report, providing the best day for the name since 2009 thanks to Kate Spade handbag sales beating expectations. Home Depot (HD) were initially higher pre-market following what seemed like a strong earnings report with beats on both EPS &amp; revenue, as well as raising its FY18 EPS forecast. However, as the conference call started HD noted some of the gains were due to favourable weather this quarter, and it also said it expects gross margins to expand by roughly 41 bps, which is slightly lower than the previous guidance, leading the stock to close slightly in the red. Elsewhere, Tesla&rsquo;s (TLSA) Musk announced he&rsquo;s working with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs to take the co. private, and it was also announced TSLA have formed a committee comprised of three independent directors for the evaluation of a potential privatisation. Yum China (YUMC) were higher after China&#39;s sovereign wealth fund and China Investment Corp announced they are in favour of taking the co. private and are seeking to do so. In M&amp;A news, Carl Icahn has taken a U-turn with his view on the Express Scripts (ESRX) &amp; Cigna (CI) deal as he stated he no longer wishes to solicit proxy advisory firms to vote against the deal. Elsewhere, California Water (CWT) submitted a revised offer for SJW Group (SJW) to USD 70/shr, a USD 1.25 increase from the previous offer. SPX +0.64% at 2840, NDX +0.60% at 7490, DJI +0.45% at 25300.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex followed its European peers on Tuesday and remained subdued amid a slightly less risk-averse tone as the situation in Turkey appears less threatening than previous days. The yield curve saw some modest bear-flattening for most of the morning US session with 2yr yield higher by c.2bps and 30yr yield by c.1bps. US 10YR T-notes settled 4+ ticks lower at 120-03+.</p>\r\n",

As an additional measure, the Turkish Central Bank opened their FX Repo auction today to alleviate pressure on the TRY, with the interest rate at 19.25% for TRY (vs. 17.75% Prev.) and 2.00% for USD. Their Repo auction however remained closed. In regards to Pastor Brunson, the US threatened Turkey with further economic pressures if they refuse to release him, while the US Charges d&lsquo;Affairs in Turkey visited the US Pastor Brunson and made reiterations for his case to be resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> SPX</strong> +0.64% at 2840, NDX +0.60% at 7490, DJI +0.45% at 25300. SECTORS: Energy +0.26%, Materials +0.77%, Industrials +0.66% Cons Discretionary +0.95%, Cons &nbsp;Staples +0.64%, Healthcare +0.45%, Financials +0.86%, Tech +0.62%, Telecoms +0.72%, Utilities +0.17%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EARNINGS</strong>: Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) surged following a beat on both top and bottom line, as well as announcing a new USD 600mln share repurchase programme. Tapestry (TPR) also soared after a strong report, providing the best day for the name since 2009 thanks to Kate Spade handbag sales beating expectations. Home Depot (HD) were initially higher pre-market following what seemed like a strong earnings report with beats on both EPS &amp; revenue, as well as raising its FY18 EPS forecast. However, as the conference call started HD noted some of the gains were due to favourable weather this quarter, and it also said it expects gross margins to expand by roughly 41 bps, which is slightly lower than the previous guidance, leading the stock to close slightly in the red.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>STOCK SPECIFICS</strong>: Tesla&rsquo;s (TLSA) Musk announced he&rsquo;s working with Silver Lake and Goldman Sachs to take the co. private, and it was also announced TSLA have formed a committee comprised of three independent directors for the evaluation of a potential privatisation. Yum China (YUMC) were higher after China&#39;s sovereign wealth fund and China Investment Corp announced they are in favour of taking the co. private, and are seeking to do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>M&amp;A</strong>: Carl Icahn has taken a U-turn with his view on the Express Scripts (ESRX) &amp; Cigna (CI) deal as he stated he no longer wishes to solicit proxy advisory firms to vote against the deal. Elsewhere, California Water (CWT) submitted a revised offer for SJW Group (SJW) to USD 70/shr, a USD 1.25 increase from the previous offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>WTI CRUDE FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 16C LOWER AT USD 67.04/BBL; BRENT CRUDE FUTURES (V8) SETTLE 15C LOWER AT USD 72.46/BBL</strong>. Crude prices ended the session relatively flat despite an initial rebound from the prior mornings sell off as markets seemed to focus on lower crude supply from Saudi Arabia and Iran. Despite the bullish price action in early trade, reports that Libya&rsquo;s Sharara oil field, which has a production capacity of 300k BPD, is now producing at a normal rate again, pushing Libya&rsquo;s overall output back to over 1mln BPD failed to spur any move. However, as the settlement approached both WTI &amp; Brent erased earlier gains to close in negative territory amid broad based USD strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tonight&rsquo;s API data Crude is expected to show a drawdown of 2.5mln barrels, distillates expecting a build of 1mln barrels and gasoline expected to report a drawdown of 600k barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 4+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-03+.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex followed its European peers on Tuesday and remained subdued amid a slightly less risk-averse tone as the situation in Turkey appears less threatening than previous days. The yield curve saw some modest bear-flattening for most of the morning US session with 2yr yield higher by c.2bps and 30yr yield by c.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*<strong> LIRA</strong>: It remains too early to call or venture with any real conviction, but the signs/omens appear somewhat better for the ailing TRY. Indeed, the Lira and EM currency counterparts witnessed considerably less volatility on their way to what looks like decent rebounds from recent lows, if not extended recovery gains. Moreover, USDTRY did not retrace too far on the latest admonishments from Turkey&rsquo;s President Erdogan or comments from his Finance Minister pledging to maintain measures to support the Lira, banks and companies, or the latter&rsquo;s proclaim that the TRY will continue to revalue. USDTRY continued to fall in afternoon trade despite broad-based USD strength, with the pair hitting lows at 6.3057, while even the ARS got a belated boost from the 500bp emergency rate hike on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>USD</strong>: After some early EU session weakness (in wake of offers around 96.400 that tripped a few stops placed at 96.150), the DXY and broad Dollar have been mainly taking cues from fluctuations elsewhere. The USD benefitted from some strength in late in afternoon which pushed the DXY above 96.700.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD, EUR</strong>: The Loonie had briefly reclaimed 1.3100 status on a combination of positive NAFTA comments from US President Trump and broad-based USD strength. The single currency failed to sustain 1.1400+ levels again even though EZ data/surveys were mostly supportive and declined later in the session as the USD appreciated across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>NZD, CHF</strong>: The Kiwi and Franc both flat vs the USD around 0.6600 and 0.9900 respectively, with the former deriving some impetus from upbeat NZ Finance Minister comments overnight (flagging upbeat economic fundamentals) and the latter unmoved on Swiss PPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>GBP</strong>: The Pound saw some temporary post-UK data upside (4% jobless rate) but could not keep hold of 1.2800 and above vs the USD before retreating further towards 1.2755 on more Brexit warnings about no deal or a disorderly withdrawal from the EU. The pair printed fresh lows towards 1.2700 on the back of late afternoon USD strength, a level which cable has not fallen through since June last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>JPY, AUD</strong>: Weaker vs the Buck from the off, with USDJPY trading in a 110.60-111.30 range, albeit largely above the big figure, and AUDUSD dropping below yesterday&rsquo;s circa 1 &frac12; year lows around 0.7250 following disappointing Chinese data and another official weakening of the CNY from the PBoC (and CNH subsequently touching 6.9000 vs the USD).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Indeed, the Lira and EM currency counterparts witnessed considerably less volatility on their way to what looks like decent rebounds from recent lows, if not extended recovery gains. Moreover, Usd/Try did not retrace too far on the latest admonishments from Turkey&rsquo;s President Erdogan or comments from his Finance Minister pledging to maintain measures to support the Lira, banks and companies, or the latter&rsquo;s proclaim that the Try will continue to revalue. Usd/Try currently around 6.5200 and within 6.4500-6.6000 parameters for the most part, while even the ARS got a belated boost from the 500 bn emergency rate hike on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some early EU session weakness (in wake of offers around 96.400 that tripped a few stops placed at 96.150), the DXY and broad Dollar have been mainly taking cues from fluctuations elsewhere, with the former ranging between 96.143 and 96.442. In terms of G10 peers, the Greenback is ending pretty evenly split with the CAD outperforming and EUR lagging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has reclaimed 1.3000 status on a combination of positive NAFTA comments from US President Trump and a decent rebound in oil prices, but the single currency failed to sustain 1.1400+ levels again even though EZ data/surveys were mostly supportive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi and Franc both firmer vs the Usd around 0.6600 and 0.9900 respectively, with the former deriving some impetus from upbeat NZ Finance Minister comments overnight (flagging upbeat economic fundamentals) and the latter unmoved on Swiss PPI data, but extending gains relative the Eur as the cross retreated through 1.1300 (which may prompt some SNB audible intervention, if not physical action).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound saw some temporary post-UK data upside (4% jobless rate), but could not keep hold of 1.2800 and above vs the Usd before retreating further towards 1.2755 lows on more Brexit warnings about no deal or a disorderly withdrawal from the EU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weaker vs the Buck from the off, with Usd/Jpy hugging the upper end of a 110.60-111.15 range, albeit largely above below the big figure, and Aud/Usd only just holding above yesterday&rsquo;s circa 1 &frac12; year lows around 0.7250 following disappointing Chinese data and another official weakening of the Cny from the PBoC (and Cnh subsequently touching 6.9000 vs the Usd).</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.1%) were higher with Australia lifted by a broad positive tone across nearly all sectors and as focus shifted back to earnings, while Japan outperformed as exporters coat-tailed on a rebound in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) underperformed their peers and traded negative amid disappointing data in which Industrial Production, Retail Sales and Fixed Urban Assets all fell short of estimates and the Unemployment Rate also increased. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker amid the improved risk appetite in Japan with prices also subdued by the absence of the BoJ&rsquo;s bond buying program from the market today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

In separate news, there were also reports that the US was said to warn Turkey again regarding Pastor Brunson. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have started the day firmer (Euro Stoxx 50 +0.2%) however gains have been trimmed as Erdogan continues his defiant tone. The FTSE is the underperforming bourse, weighed on by mining names. This coming in the wake of poor Antofagasta earnings, which were hit by a 16% drop in core earnings, and are close to the foot of the Stoxx 600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Home Depot Inc (HD) Q2 EPS USD 3.05 vs. Exp. USD 2.84, revenue USD 30.5bln vs. Exp. USD 30.03bln</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have rebounded relatively firmly from new Liffe lows and some volatility in wake of a rather mixed UK jobs and earnings update, with a brief sell-off on the 4% unemployment rate and record level of vacancies reversed on the less upbeat elements like claims, headline pay growth and employment change. The 10 year benchmark is now around 123.31 vs 123.38 at best and the 123.16 base, while Bunds remain nearer the bottom of their 163.11-35 range after mainly better than expected Eurozone releases via prelim national and pan GDP estimates and ZEW indices. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are softer and steeper amidst the overall improvement in risk appetite due to Try/EM respite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - A more concerted Try recovery has filtered through the region and beyond again, with a broad improvement in other &lsquo;risky&rsquo; currencies and sentiment overall. The Lira is currently pivoting 6.5000 vs the Usd vs 7.2000+ levels at one stage yesterday, as the CBRT augments its RRR interventions via a hike in financing costs at the latest FX auction, albeit not actually opening the repo for a 2nd day presumably due to no excessive demand for extra funds/liquidity. Elsewhere, the Rand, Rouble and Peso are also paring heavy losses, for the time being at least after similar rebounds in Asian counterparts overnight, bar the Yuan that was undermined buy a raft of sub-consensus Chinese data overnight and yet another higher Usd/Cny midpoint fixing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/NZD - The top or better G10 performers as the Loonie extends its rebound vs the Greenback to 1.3100 and even higher at one stage on latest NAFTA news (specifically US President Trump stating that things will be sorted with Canada and Mexico, while Canada&rsquo;s Finance Minister Morneau believes the framework can be improved to benefit all 3 nations). Cable has been choppy around 1.2800 and UK data with a knee-jerk rise on the lowest jobless rate since 1975, before waning on worse than expected claimant count and mixed average earnings. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is holding up relatively well within a 0.6570-0.6605 range amidst upbeat comments from NZ Finance Minister Robertson, noting strong domestic economic fundamentals and the pluses for exporters from Nzd weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/JPY/EUR - All flat or weaker vs the Dollar after some volatile price action and data, but with the Franc largely shrugging off Swiss producer and import prices and still meandering between 0.9910-45. However, the Aud continues to trade in line with Chinese counterparts and data amidst the ongoing US trade spat and is back down near Monday&rsquo;s multi-month low circa 0.7250, while the Jpy has retreated sharply to 111.00 or just under and the single currency continues to face resistance above 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index remains underpinned above 96.000, but equally toppy around 96.500 with moves largely emanating from basket components and pairings on the back of Try/EM fluctuations. Indeed, the DXY and broad Usd traded down to lows when the Lira was around 6.4000 peaks, but then bounced after the latest speech from Turkish President Erdogan as the Try lost momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is benefitting from the return to a positive risk tone and has erased the previous sessions losses, with both WTI and Brent up ~0.8% on the day, with traders looking ahead to the latest API release with expectations set to show a draw in Crude by 3.27mln, Distillates to build by 0.9mln and Gasoline to draw by 0.8mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is flat whilst copper has fallen for the third day straight and pushed YTD losses to 16% as poor Chinese retail sales data suggests demand could slow from the Asian country. Silver (+0.7%), platinum (+0.9%) and palladium (+0.1%) were all beneficiaries of the improved risk sentiment, however, with all of the precious metals up on the day.</p>\r\n",

The FTSE (flat) is the underperforming bourse, weighed on by mining names. This coming in the wake of poor Antofagasta (-5.8%) earnings, which were hit by a 16% drop in core earnings, and are close to the foot of the Stoxx 600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both RWE (+2.8%) and Straumann (+1.9%) also reported in European trade, with the co.&rsquo;s beating on expectations. This has propelled them to the top of the Stoxx 600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - A more concerted Try recovery has filtered through the region and beyond again, with a broad improvement in other &lsquo;risky&rsquo; currencies and sentiment overall. The Lira is currently pivoting 6.5000 vs the Usd vs 7.2000+ levels at one stage yesterday, as the CBRT augments its RRR interventions via a hike in financing costs at the latest FX auction, albeit not actually opening the repo for a 2nd day presumably due to no excessive demand for extra funds/liquidity. Elsewhere, the Rand, Rouble and Peso are also paring heavy losses, for the time being at least after similar rebounds in Asian counterparts overnight, bar the Yuan that was undermined buy a raft of sub-consensus Chinese data overnight and yet another higher Usd/Cny midpoint fixing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP/NZD - The top or better G10 performers as the Loonie extends its rebound vs the Greenback to 1.3100 and even higher at one stage on latest NAFTA news (specifically US President Trump stating that things will be sorted with Canada and Mexico, while Canada&rsquo;s Finance Minister Morneau believes the framework can be improved to benefit all 3 nations). Cable has been choppy around 1.2800 and UK data with a knee-jerk rise on the lowest jobless rate since 1975, before waning on worse than expected claimant count and mixed average earnings. Elsewhere, the Kiwi is holding up relatively well within a 0.6570-0.6605 range amidst upbeat comments from NZ Finance Minister Robertson, noting strong domestic economic fundamentals and the pluses for exporters from Nzd weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/AUD/JPY/EUR - All flat or weaker vs the Dollar after some volatile price action and data, but with the Franc largely shrugging off Swiss producer and import prices and still meandering between 0.9910-45. However, the Aud continues to trade in line with Chinese counterparts and data amidst the ongoing US trade spat and is back down near Monday&rsquo;s multi-month low circa 0.7250, while the Jpy has retreated sharply to 111.00 or just under and the single currency continues to face resistance above 1.1400.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index remains underpinned above 96.000, but equally toppy around 96.500 with moves largely emanating from basket components and pairings on the back of Try/EM fluctuations. Indeed, the DXY and broad Usd traded down to lows when the Lira was around 6.4000 peaks, but then bounced after the latest speech from Turkish President Erdogan as the Try lost momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts have rebounded relatively firmly from new Liffe lows and some volatility in wake of a rather mixed UK jobs and earnings update, with a brief sell-off on the 4% unemployment rate and record level of vacancies reversed on the less upbeat elements like claims, headline pay growth and employment change. The 10 year benchmark is now around 123.31 vs 123.34 at best and the 123.16 base, while Bunds remain nearer the bottom of their 163.11-35 range after mainly better than expected Eurozone releases via prelim national and pan GDP estimates and ZEW indices. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are softer and steeper amidst the overall improvement in risk appetite due to Try/EM respite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is benefitting from the return to a positive risk tone and has erased the previous session&rsquo;s losses, with both WTI and Brent up ~0.9% on the day, and now traders looking ahead to the latest API release with expectations for a draw in Crude by 3.27mln, Distillates to build by 0.9mln and Gasoline to draw by 0.8mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is flat whilst copper has fallen for the third day straight and pushed YTD losses to 16% as poor Chinese retail sales data suggests demand could slow from the Asian country. Silver (+0.7%), platinum (+0.9%) and palladium (+0.1%) were all beneficiaries of the improved risk sentiment.</p>\r\n",

Wage growth remains the focus, with Average Earnings (Ex-Bonus) expected at 2.7%. This would mean that wages marginally exceeded headline CPI and developed real income growth for the 5th consecutive month. Coupling this with an unemployment rate forecast to stay at 4.2% in spite of fewer jobs added to the economy than previously (98k vs. 137k Prev.) would support the BoE&rsquo;s rhetoric of a tightening labour market and may offer a floor to a GBP that has been sliding ever since the BoE&rsquo;s meeting on August 8th, Brussels permitting, of course.</p>\r\n",

First and foremost, the beleaguered Try has extended its rebound overnight, albeit with official aid in the form of Monday&rsquo;s CBRT indirect intervention, while Italian BTPs are also on the rebound following pledges by the Populist Government to cut the country&rsquo;s heavy debt load. Hence, Bunds are on the retreat again after a flattish start vs yesterday&rsquo;s 163.36 close to a 163.12 early low. Ahead, ZEW&rsquo;s August survey and more hard data in the form of pan Eurozone growth after the aforementioned German release. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, the improvement in risk-tone helped USD/JPY and JPY-crosses sustain their recovery while commodity-linked currencies also saw mild gains amid the rebound in crude, although upside in AUD was contained by the disappointing Chinese data and softness in CNH after the PBoC continued to weaken the reference rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were relatively flat with WTI crude futures marginally higher as trade stabilized from the prior day&rsquo;s volatility in which prices slumped briefly below USD 66/bbl before paring nearly all the losses to reclaim the USD 67/bbl level heading into the settlement. Elsewhere, gold languished and only managed to nurse a miniscule portion of Monday&rsquo;s USD-induced losses, while copper was indecisive amid similar price action across the complex and the mixed overnight risk tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Escondida copper mine workers union are to extend discussions with the BHP for another day. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House said National Security Adviser Bolton met with Turkish Ambassador Kilic at the White House in which they discussed Pastor Brunson and US-Turkey relations, while the meeting was said to be at the Turkish ambassador&#39;s request. In separate news, there were also reports that the US was said to warn Turkey again regarding Pastor Brunson. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasury yields rebounded from the 4-week lows seen in recent. The complex edged lower after the Turkish Central Bank announced liquidity release on Monday contributing to easing some global tensions. The yield curve saw some modest bear-steepening as most of the action was concentrated in the long end of the curve where 30yr yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. 5s30s and 10s30s widened by c.1.5bps, 2s5s narrowed by c.1bps. US 10YR T-notes settled 4 ticks lower at 120-08.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated during public fundraiser that they will straighten it out with Mexico and Canada. Elsewhere, there were also earlier comments from Canada&rsquo;s Finance Minister Morneau that the NAFTA framework can be improved to benefit all three parties and added they will have more to say about steel trade soon.

ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.8%) were higher with Australia lifted by a broad positive tone across nearly all sectors and as focus shifted back to earnings, while Japan outperformed as exporters coat-tailed on a rebound in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.8%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) underperformed their peers and traded negative amid disappointing data in which Industrial Production, Retail Sales and Fixed Urban Assets all fell short of estimates and the Unemployment Rate also increased. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker amid the improved risk appetite in Japan with prices also subdued by the absence of the BoJ&rsquo;s bond buying program from the market today.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.8%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.3%) are higher with Australia lifted by a broad positive tone across nearly all sectors and with focus shifting back to earnings, while Japan outperforms as exporters coat-tail on a rebound in USD/JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.2%) underperform their peers and trade negative amid disappointing data in which Industrial Production, Retail Sales and Fixed Urban Assets all fell short of estimates and the Unemployment Rate also increased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets have calmed from the prior day&rsquo;s EM sell-off with the USD index relatively flat above the 96.00 level, while its counterparts struggle for direction with EUR/USD barely holding above 1.1400 and with GBP/USD kept rangebound at the 1.2700 handle. Elsewhere, the improvement in risk-tone has helped USD/JPY and JPY-crosses sustain their recovery while commodity-linked currencies also saw mild gains amid the rebound in crude, although upside in AUD is contained by the disappointing Chinese data and softness in CNH after the PBoC continued to weaken the reference rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are weaker amid the improved risk appetite in Japan with prices also subdued by the absence of the BoJ in the market today.</p>\r\n",
