        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20818/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US MARKET WRAP &ndash; 20th December: Equities tumble in post FOMC trade; NASDAQ enters bear market</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:</strong> Equities down, treasuries down, dollar down, crude down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>BoE unchanged but Brexit uncertainties intensified, Banxico hikes by 25bps, Brexit meaningful vote set for January 15th, Trump not to sign legislation until perfect border security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AHEAD:</strong> UK GDP, US Durable Goods, GDP Final &amp; Core PCE, Canadian GDP &amp; Retail Sales, Quadruple Witching</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE:</strong> The Bank of England kept rates unchanged, as expected, in a unanimous vote. Guidance was also untouched as the bank reiterated that ongoing tightening of monetary policy at a gradual pace and to a limited extent is appropriate. Nonetheless a tone of caution emerged in regard to the economic outlook; the MPC highlighted that Brexit uncertainties have intensified considerably since the November meeting while a policy response is unlikely to be automatic, and could be a two-way decision. The MPC also noted that inflation is slowing on the back of exogenous factors and therefore sees CPI slipping beneath 2% in the coming months following the recent slump in oil prices, likely hitting 1.75% in 2019. On the flip side, domestic inflationary pressure continues to build offering hopes for a hike at the meeting in May, assuming the UK will leave the EU with a deal, Rabobank says. Current guidance sees the next rate hike in May 2020; ING believes this view is a tad too pessimistic and depending on Brexit, the bank should see a hike sooner. Similarly, Lloyds states &ldquo;there is scope for the Bank&rsquo;s tone to turn more hawkish in response to developments in the domestic economy&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GOVT SHUTDOWN: </strong>US President Trump said he will not sign any legislation &quot;unless it has a perfect border security&rdquo;. Note Trump was referring to the senate funding bill passed late on Wednesday that would have kept the government funded up to February 8th, avoiding a partial government shutdown. Additionally, a Politico reporter citing sources stated that the White House has no idea what the plan is for the stop gap spending bill, concerns are rampant that Trump could veto the bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The Washington Post reported that US allies will reportedly call out China for economic espionage. Separately, the EU has launched a second challenge against China at WTO over forced technology transfers. Also, EU sources suggested that the US report on car tariffs will be delayed until mid-January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK House of Commons leader Leadsom says parliament will begin the debate on PM May&#39;s Brexit deal on January 9th while the Brexit meaningful vote Is now set to take place on January 15th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BANXICO: </strong>The Mexico&rsquo;s Central Bank hiked interest rates by 25bps to 8.25% from 8.00% as expected. The vote was unanimous. The bank stated that monetary policy will be adjusted in an opportune and firm manner to bring inflation to target; it reiterated that risk for growth continues to be tilted to the downside. Focus fell also on the currency, with the bank noting that the peso exchange rate has continued to reflect uncertainty surrounding the policies of the new administration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 2.29 LOWER AT USD 45.88/BBL, BRENT (G9) FUTURES SETTLE USD 2.89 LOWER AT USD 54.35. </strong>Crude was defensive, once again taking its cue from soft risk sentiment following a less-dovish-than-hoped-for-FOMC on Wednesday. &ldquo;The larger message, we think, is that this represents a deepening gloom rather than any shocking weakness in the underlying fundamentals,&rdquo; Citi said. Not helping the complex was news from Libya, where reports continue to suggest that Sharara production is set to be resumed, although NOC officials have not confirmed. Citi&rsquo;s analysts have put forward a positive spin, however, noting that while there may be an outright recession om the world&rsquo;s intermediate-term future, slower growth might not be a terrible outcome: &ldquo;lower valuations can also lay the groundwork for a recovery when worst fears are not realised,&rdquo; adding that for the oil market, OPEC+ producers continue to work in the background to reduce supply with the aim of supporting prices. On the note of OPEC, the cartel will detail individual country quotas for the supply cut deal, publishing details in January, which analysts said would help the market keep score on the group&rsquo;s progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SPX -1.59% at 2467, NDX -1.57% at 6243, DJI -2.00% at 22856. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -2.82%, Materials -1.31%, Industrials -1.82%, Cons Discretionary -2.26%, Cons Staples -1.76%, Healthcare -1.30%, Financials -0.79%, Tech -1.89%, Telecoms -1.63%, Utilities +0.25%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Newell Brands (NWL) outperformed after investor Carl Icahn increased his stake in the household products co. Altria (MO) opened in the green on the back of a minority stake acquisition of e-cigarette co. JUUL Labs. As most sectors sold off today, investors moved into the defensive utilities sector, with Duke (DUK) and Dominion (D) both outperforming. Conagra Brands (CAG) traded lower after reporting a fall in quarterly net sales. Walgreens Boots (WBA) opened lower as it reported below estimate same store sales. Accenture (ACN) underperformed as it lowered its guidance. Oil stocks suffered as crude prices moved lower. Carnival (CCL) gave EPS guidance below estimates bringing its stock price into the red, as well as competitors Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE&nbsp; 3+ TICKS AT 120-02.</strong> Treasuries ended Thursday session in negative territory falling to a eight-month low in the aftermath of the FOMC meeting; investors also moved away from equities amid worries of a slowdown in global growth. The complex extended gains after US President Trump announced he would not sign a bill unless border security is considered which means the government will partially close on Friday. The yield curve flattened and most of the actions was concentrated in the front end of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps. Spreads widened across the curve with 2s10s and 2s5s wider by c.1bps</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback grinded higher, with the index nudging back up to circa 96.500 at one point, before edging back towards 96.200 amidst a sharp reappraisal of initial FOMC perceptions that were deemed considerably less dovish than expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, SEK: </strong>The clear G10 outperformers, with the former benefiting from pronounced post-FOMC risk aversion and less divergence between JGB and UST yields amidst further yield curve flattening, while the latter was boosted by the Riksbank&rsquo;s decision to lift the Swedish repo rate now rather than later (February 2019 was the alternative). Usd/Jpy sitting close to 111.00 and Eur/Sek gave major chart support at 10.2400 a real test even though the Riksbank also lowered its hike path like the Fed (now 1 rise in 2019 vs 2 previously, then 2 per annum in both 2020 and 2021).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>The next best major and almost gleaning enough momentum to arouse massive option expiry interest and challenge barrier defences at the 1.1500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, GBP, AUD:</strong> All still firmer vs the Usd, but also off best levels given the broad Buck bounce, with the Franc back below 0.9900, Cable around 1.2650 again and Aud/Usd just above 0.7100 (compared to 0.9865, 1.2705 and 0.7150 or thereabouts respectively. Earlier, the Chf and Pound were underpinned by upbeat data (Swiss trade and UK retail sales), while the Aud benefited from cross-flows and switching out of the NZD that fell to 1.0550+ and 0.6725 lows on the back of disappointing NZ growth in Q3 and ANZ&rsquo;s forecast for a 25 bp RBNZ ease in November next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie derived some traction against the backdrop of renewed/pronounced weakness in oil and strained Chinese relations from a beat in Canadian wholesale trade to stay off 1.3500+ lows vs its US counterpart.</p>\r\n",

Not helping the complex was news from Libya, where reports continue to suggest that Sharara production is set to be resumed, although NOC officials have not confirmed. Citi&rsquo;s analysts have put forward a positive spin, however, noting that while there may be an outright recession om the world&rsquo;s intermediate-term future, slower growth might not be a terrible outcome: &ldquo;lower valuations can also lay the groundwork for a recovery when worst fears are not realised,&rdquo; adding that for the oil market, OPEC+ producers continue to work in the background to reduce supply with the aim of supporting prices. On the note of OPEC, the cartel will detail individual country quotas for the supply cut deal, publishing details in January, which analysts said would help the market keep score on the group&rsquo;s progress.</p>\r\n",

Elsewhere, sliding crude prices and the Canadian-Chinese diplomatic situation continues to weigh heavily on the Loonie, but the Cad has rebounded from 1.3500+ lows to circa 1.3450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regional currencies now all in the ascendency vs the Usd and regaining lost ground after the initial Fed fall-out and rout in risk assets.</p>\r\n",

Bunds may also be deriving some underlying support from mild BTP underperformance following initial euphoria, relief or possibly over-exuberance in wake of the Italian-EU budget accord. From a tech perspective, 163.88 is resistance ahead of 164.00 and then 164.15.</p>\r\n",

Crucially, the FOMC lowered its estimate of the neutral rate (to 2.8% from 3.0%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The central bank softened its guidance on future rate hikes, saying that &ldquo;some further gradual increases&rdquo; to rates (versus the previous &ldquo;further gradual increases&rdquo;). In terms of risks to the outlook, the Fed continues to see these as &ldquo;roughly balanced&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Markets initially reacted with caution, with ES (H19) and T-Notes moving lower (T-Notes recovered thereafter, sending 10-year yields to the lowest since May), upside was seen in the USD. Many saw reaction as a result of the narrowing of the trajectory of normalisation as an acknowledgement of slowing growth momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In his statement, Chair Powell said &ldquo;cross-currents&rdquo; have emerged, and the Fed has seen developments that signal softening ahead, though the developments have not fundamentally altered its outlook. Powell reiterated comments from October that policy is not on a pre-set course, and talked about the Fed&rsquo;s data-dependency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Powell said the FOMC sees some moderation of growth in 2019; tightening financial conditions and slower growth led the Fed to mark down inflation projections. Powell suggested that inflation trends can allow the Fed with patience in normalising policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- On the neutral rate, he suggested we are now at the bottom-end of the estimate of the neutral rate, while stating that there is a high degree of uncertainty about the path of future hikes; Powell stated that policy does not need to be accommodate and it was appropriate to be neutral. He also said the Fed took tightening financial conditions into account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- On independence, Powell said political concerns played no role in the FOMC&rsquo;s deliberations, and nothing would deter the Fed from doing what it thinks it the right approach. Elsewhere, Fed Chair Powell said that balance sheet policy will remain on auto-pilot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Through his press conference, ES futures continued to slide, while the USD continued to appreciate and T-Notes printed highs of 121-13+. Markets attributed this to Powell striking a cautious tone; specifically, 2019 will see a slowdown of growth, and there was a high degree of uncertainty on the rate trajectory. Additionally, he does not believe policy needs to be accommodative, and said neutral policy was now appropriate, giving traders little reason to jump into risk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equities drowned in a sea of red following the decline seen on Wall St. post-FOMC where the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all dived to fresh YTD lows and tech-giant Apple sunk over 3%.

Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-1.1%) was weighed on by financial names (China Banks sector -2.3%) after the PBoC refrained from raising reverse repo rates following the FOMC and HKMA 25bps hikes. Meanwhile, Hang Seng (-1.5%) was pressured by the regional risk sentiment alongside weakness in the property and financial sectors, on the flip side, shares in Rusal provided the industrial sector with modest support after spiking higher in excess of 20% after the reports that US will terminated sanctions against the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hong Kong Monetary Authority raised rates by 25bps to 2.75% in lockstep with the Fed, as expected.

DXY fluctuated on either side of the 97.000 handle following the FOMC rate decision which turned out to be less dovish than markets expected. As such, EUR/USD remained sub-1.1400 and around its 50 DMA at 1.1384, while GBP/USD was choppy above 1.2600. Meanwhile, USD/JPY was initially dominated by the greenback as the pair hovered around 112.50 before safe-haven flows took the pair below its 100 DMA (112.41) and recent low (112.09) to test the big figure to the downside. Elsewhere, NZD is the marked underperformer after the currency received a double whammy from disappointing Q3 GDP alongside ANZ forecasting a 25bps cut to the RBNZ OCR in November next year, subsequently NZD/USD fell below 0.6750 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6733. Meanwhile AUD/USD tested 0.7100 to the downside after a muted reaction to the Australian jobs data as part-time jobs mostly contributed to the rise in the employment change, while full time jobs fell by 6.4K. Finally, USD/CNY rose above 6.9000 to levels last seen at the end of November as the PBoC introduced a targeted lending measure to support growth, as well as refraining to raise rates after the HKMA hiked by 25bps, in lock-step with the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ANZ expects the RBNZ to cut the OCR in November 2019; and added that through 2020, they see the Cash Rate declining to as low as 1.00% (currently 1.75%).

        "content": "<p>Asian equities are lower across the board following the decline seen on Wall St. post-FOMC where the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq all dived to fresh YTD lows while tech-giant Apple sunk over 3%. ASX 200 (-0.4%) is mostly pressured by the material sector as metals fell with the Fed-induced USD strength, while similarly, Nikkei 225 (-1.8%) retreats further from the 21,000 handle to levels last seen in March as its heavy mining sector slumps. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) is weighed on by financial names (China Banks sector -1.9%) after the PBoC refrained from raising reverse repo rates after the Fed and HKMA hiked rates by 25bps. Meanwhile, Hang Seng (-0.6%) is pressured by the regional risk sentiment alongside weakness in the property and financial sectors, however, shares in Rusal provided the index with some support after spiking higher in excess of 20% after the US terminated sanctions against the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets. DXY fluctuates on either side of the 97.000 handle following the FOMC interest rate decision which turned out to be less dovish than markets expected. As such, EUR/USD remains sub-1.1400 and just below its 50 DMA at 1.1384, while GBP/USD remains choppy above 1.2600. Meanwhile, USD/JPY is also dominated by the greenback as the pair hovers around 112.50, in between its 50 DMA and 100 DMA at 112.99 and 112.41 respectively. Elsewhere, NZD is the marked underperformer after the currency received a double whammy from disappointing Q3 GDP alongside ANZ now forecasting a 25bps cut to the RBNZ OCR, subsequently NZD/USD straddles just under 0.6750 ahead of its 50 DMA at 0.6733. Meanwhile AUD/USD holds above 0.7100 after a muted reaction to the Australian jobs data as part-time jobs mostly contributed to the rise in employment change, while full time jobs fell by 7K. Finally, USD/CNY rose to levels last seen at the end of November as the PBoC left reverse repo rates operation rates unchanged after the HKMA hiked in lock-step with the Fed.</p>\r\n",
