        "content": "<p>* SNAP-SHOT: Stocks down, USD up, treasuries down, oil up * REAR-VIEW: Trump tweet on NAFTA, potential sanctions relief on Rusal, Sohn Conference * AHEAD: Australian CPI, German Ifo Survey, Verizon, Coca-Cola and 3M earnings<br />* TRADE WARS: Immigration was back in the spotlight on Monday, after US President Trump tweeted &ldquo;Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast.&rdquo; In response, Mexico Foreign Minister Videgaray said it was unacceptable to condition NAFTA on the immigration issue. Earlier on Monday, Mexican President Nieto expressed hopes for a new NAFTA deal agreement soon.&nbsp;<br />* GEOPOLITICS: &nbsp;North Korean leader Kim on Monday confirmed the nation has suspended missile tests, adding that he is looking to shut down one of its nuclear sites. US President Trump is likely to clarify that nuclear dismantling North Korea must precede economic benefits although a senior administration official also stated that North Korea will have to earn lifting of sanctions, according to the WSJ noted, a line that was also alluded to by White House officials too. Separately, BBC sources noted Saudi air defence units intercepted two ballistic missiles which were fired by Houthi military towards Aramco facility in Jazan. Elsewhere, focus will be on French PM Macron&rsquo;s meeting Trump over the Iran nuclear accord, which has been a key plank of western policy for containing military tensions in the Middle East. &nbsp;<br />* FEDSPEAK: Fed&#39;s Williams (voter, hawkish) noted significant trade war would have very negative economic effects, adding that removal of extraordinary measures should be very gradual and with no quick changes. Williams also told Spanish newspaper ABC that the Fed can continue to lift rates without revealing new information. &nbsp;<br />* EQUITIES: SPX 0.01% at 2670, NDX -0.28% at 6649, DJI 0.06% at 24449 &nbsp;SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): &nbsp;+0.33%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): -0.10%, ENERGY (XLE): +0.64%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -0.08%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.37%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -0.12%, MATERIALS (XLB): 0.38%, TECH (XLK): -0.44%, TELECOMS (XTL): +1.07%, UTILITIES (XLU): +0.08%. &nbsp;<br />Stocks opened higher but slipped into negative territory as rising bond yields pushed investors away from equities and overshadowing earnings optimism. The tech sector was the laggard in all three major indices immediately followed by the metal bloc (X, AKS, AA, ARNC) which suffered major losses following the announcement of possible Rusal&rsquo;s sanctions relief. In M&amp;A news CenterPoint Energy (CNP) expressed interest in purchasing Vectren (VVC) for roughly USD 6bln to diversify its consumer base, Subsea 7 Made an unsolicited offer for McDermott (MDR) stating it would offer USD 2bln, which would potentially break up the deal with Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron. Elsewhere, Newell Brands (NWL) entered an agreement with Starboard to end a proxy content. &nbsp;<br />* CRUDE: WTI futures settle up 24 cents at USD 68.64/bbl, Brent futures settle up 65 cents at USD 74.71/bbl. Oil prices were weaker in early US trade, despite weekend news that Libya output had fallen by 80k BPD due to militants attacks in Waha (Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have now resumed loading operations). The crude complex was pressured by the news that the US could relieve sanctions on Russia&rsquo;s Rusal, in another sign that the US may not have the appetite to follow through with aggressive rhetoric, helping to deflate some of the geopolitical premium in crude prices. Shortly afterwards, the Iranian oil minister suggested that if crude prices continued to rise, there might not be a need to extend the current OPEC+ supply cut deal, which runs through the end of the year, compounding losses. However, later in the session, crude gradually pared back losses as it appeared that the US was still entertaining the notion of withdrawing from the Iran accord, as was argued by White House Legislative Director Short. In other news, Iran suggested that it would be prepared to do whatever necessary to counter Donald Trump and protect its oil interests, while also noting the fall in the Iran&rsquo;s March crude and condensate exports was only temporary (currently stands at 2.5mln bpd). Separately, Iraqi official said that the country is hitting its oil inventory target, which is moving toward the 5-year average, in line with comments from OPEC SecGen Barkindo over the weekend. Iraqi oil minister also added that higher oil prices were not always in its benefit. &nbsp;<br />* TREASURIES: US 10yr T-Notes futures settle 7 ticks lower at 119-10+. &nbsp;Treasuries closed modestly lower on the day, amid quiet trade, with most of the action concentrated on the front end and belly of the curve, with both 5s30s and 2s30s widening by c.2bp. The 10-year Treasury yield is consolidating a shade beneath 3.00% amid growing debt supply and faster inflation, printing recent highs at 2.9980 the highest since January 2014.&nbsp;<br />* FOREX: DXY Forming a firm foothold above the 90.500 level and the first line of resistance above in the 90.600 area as the Greenback extends gains vs G10 rivals, other majors and EM currencies. The psychological 90.750 level is now being tested even though the 10 year US Treasury has not quite printed 3%, and the next upside technical level is 90.932 ahead of 91.000. JPY/AUD/NZD The biggest losers vs a resurgent Dollar, with USDJPY finally tripping stops between 108.25-30 to seriously test a key fib just shy of 108.50 around 108.44 amidst more dovish BoJ rhetoric from Governor Kuroda ahead of Friday&rsquo;s policy meeting. AUDUSD has fallen to a fresh 2018 low around 0.7615 and only barriers plus sentimentality at 0.7600 stands between here and a steeper reversal from 0.7800+ peaks only registered last week. Nzd/Usd is only just holding above 0.7150 amidst its own fall from grace having been up to 0.7400 earlier this month. Ahead RBA&rsquo;s Kent may offer the Aud some respite or at least independent direction. CAD/EUR/GBP Ranging between 0.40.5% softer vs the USD, with the Loonie not just a victim of the broad Greenback rally, but also undermined by more&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;disappointing Canadian data and this time a huge miss (wholesale trade -0.8% vs forecasts ranging from 0.3-0.6%. Note, BoC&rsquo;s Poloz and Wilkins speak later with USDCAD testing resistance just below 1.2850. EURUSD looks in danger of losing grip of the 1.2200 handle, if the 1.2215 April low so far and 100 DMA at 1.2205 give way, while Cable has little in terms of technical props before 1.3900 now that 1.4000 and 1.3950 have both been breached to the downside.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

However, this has not prompted much in the way of retracement or follow-through leaving core debt futures and cash bonds poised at or very close to pivotal levels, awaiting input from US participants for the next big move. Bunds have bounced around 20 ticks off the 157.62 low, Gilts are 10-15 ticks above the 121.12 Liffe base and then T-note future is 4 ticks from the 119-065 overnight trough, which in turn is only a couple of ticks away from the next downside chart support. On that note, Bund bears will be eyeing 157.34 and Gilt sellers 121.04. Similar story in FX, where the Usd and index has crossed several key/big figure lines, but braced for more direction.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) were mixed with weakness in Japan the result of last week&rsquo;s flows into JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) and Hang Seng (-0.5%) were choppy amid a lack of drivers and a neutral position by the PBoC which injected CNY 80bln via reverse repos to match maturing operations, although underperformance was observed in Hong Kong names. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower amid spill over selling from USTs and as yields tracked the upside in their US counterparts, in which the US 10yr yield printed its highest since January 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day reverse repos for a daily net neutral position.

Switzerland&rsquo;s SMI is underperforming as index heavyweight UBS (-3.1%) lags following earnings. Sector wise, consumer staples underperform while Reckitt Benckiser (-2.2%) are at the bottom of the FTSE 100 following a downgrade at Raymond James and a target price cut at JP Morgan. In terms of stocks specifics, Fresenius (+0.6%) shares are higher following the terminations of the Akorn merger amid data breaches. Fresenius Medical (-3.6%) is at the foot of the DAX 30 following a revenue target cut for this year. Capita (+10.1%) is the best performing in the Stoxx 600 following earnings and reports the company is to raise GBP 701mln in a 3 for 2 rights issue entirely underwritten by Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmer US rates are certainly fuelling the latest Dollar revival and the Greenback&rsquo;s broad gains, but latest conciliatory noises from NK on the nuclear front are also undermining the traditional safe-haven currencies. The index is now comfortably above 90.500 and 90.600 resistance, looking at 90.750 next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JPY/EUR</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both on the brink of breaking out of recent ranges, with Usd/Jpy up through 108.00 offers, a big barrier and resistance extending to 108.20, but capped just ahead of stops reportedly lying between 108.25-30, while Eur/Usd has breached last Friday&rsquo;s 1.2250 low having failed to reach 1.2300 in wake of better than forecast Eurozone flash PMIs, and is now also below the next downside technical support level at 1.2235, eyeing 1.2200</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/NZD/AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.25% down vs the Dollar, with Usd/Chf around 0.9770, Nzd/Usd sub-0.7200 and Aud/Usd down through the previous YtD low (0.7643) amidst at least 2 bearish big bank &lsquo;trades of the week&rsquo;. The latter pair will be eyeing 0.7620-15, which is the 2016 base before barriers said to be waiting at 0.7600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Cad looks is revisiting 1.2800+ on the aforementioned supportive Greenback narrative and contrasting Loonie weights in the form of last Friday&rsquo;s CPI data and a still cautious BoC, although latest NAFTA reports indicate a deal could be reached in early May. The range has been 1.2750-1.2805, and the recent peak is circa 1.2820 (February 9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Losing traction around the 1.4000 level<strong> </strong>after last week&rsquo;s heavy losses on a mixture of UK data misses and dovish or less hawkish BoE policy guidance from Governor Carney. Looking to test chart support around 1.3960 while Eur/Gbp is nudging up towards the high of a 0.8745-75 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try, Rub and Zar markedly underperforming amidst the higher US Treasury yield environment and with regional political factors also a drag on the Rand in particular. However the Mxn may derive support from latest reports on NAFTA, with the Mexican President saying a deal would come soon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt on the back foot, with the 10 year benchmark initially down 15 ticks on its return to Liffe then succumbing to additional selling pressure and a 121.12 low vs the 121.52 previous settlement after staging a relatively firm rebound to 121.47 at best. Gilts look somewhat caught between the overall bearish tone in fixed and especially US Treasuries, but a less hawkish near term BoE outlook following last week&rsquo;s run of disappointing data, on balance. Hence, the UK STIR strip is seeing more short end outperformance/resilience vs the back months a tick or so either side of parity, and in fact Gilts are holding up better than core bond counterparts, as the 10 year Treasury yield inches ever closer to 3% while Bunds have posted a deeper Eurex session base at 157.62 (-51 ticks) amidst firmer than forecast Eurozone flash PMIs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices dipping in Monday trade with WTI down 0.6% at USD 68/bbl. This follows Baker Hughes reporting an increased rig count on Friday, which is now at its highest level since March 2015, suggesting increased US production putting downward pressure on the fossil fuel, as well as tweets from the US President suggesting oil is &ldquo;artificially high&rdquo; due to OPEC. The strengthening dollar is also weighing on gold with the yellow metal down 0.5% on the day. Some OPEC specific news coming from the Azerbaijani energy minister who says the country joining OPEC is not on the agenda.</p>\r\n",

Stops are seen in Usd/Jpy from 108.25-30, while nearest tech support for Eur/Usd comes in a 1.2235.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CHF/NZD/AUD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.25% down vs the Dollar, with Usd/Chf around 0.9770, Nzd/Usd sub-0.7200 and Aud/Usd hovering just above 0.7650 amidst at least 2 bearish big bank &lsquo;trades of the week&rsquo;. The latter pair is mere pips away from the 0.7643 ytd low, and if that fails to hold then sellers will be eyeing 0.7620-15, which is the 2016 base before barriers said to be waiting at 0.7600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CAD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usd/Cad looks set to revisit 1.2800 on the aforementioned supportive Greenback narrative and contrasting Loonie weights in the form of last Friday&rsquo;s CPI data and a still cautious BoC, although latest NAFTA reports indicate a deal could be reached in early May. The range has been 1.2750-85, and recent peak circa 1.2820 (February 9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actually holding up better than its G10 rivals vs the Usd, with Cable pivoting 1.4000 and Eur/Gbp back under 0.8750, with some consolidation after last week&rsquo;s heavy losses on a mixture of UK data misses and dovish or less hawkish BoE policy guidance from Governor Carney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try, Rub and Zar markedly underperforming amidst the higher US Treasury yield environment and with regional political factors also a drag on the Rand in particular.</p>\r\n",

Hence, the UK STIR strip is seeing more short end outperformance/resilience vs the back months a tick or so either side of parity, and in fact Gilts are holding up better than core bond counterparts, as the 10 year Treasury yield inches ever closer to 3% while Bunds have posted a deeper Eurex session base at 157.71 (-42 ticks) amidst firmer than forecast Eurozone flash PMIs.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets begin the week lacklustre after last Friday&rsquo;s losses on Wall St where all majors declined on continued tech weakness and losses in Apple amid concerns regarding iPhone demand. However, overnight pressure is also contained in the Asia-Pac region amid a further improvement of the geopolitical climate in the Korean peninsula after North Korea announced it will stop nuclear and ICBM testing, as well as begin dismantling a nuclear test site in the north of the country. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) are mixed with weakness in Japan the result of last week&rsquo;s flows into JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) is choppy amid a lack of any major drivers and a neutral position by the PBoC which injected CNY 80bln via reverse repos to match maturing operations, while the Hang Seng (-0.5%) underperforms on tech-related declines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback remains firm and the DXY above 90.00 as its major counterparts languish from recent losses with EUR/USD below 1.2300, while GBP/USD finds mild support at the 1.4000 level but still has some distance to recoup the lost ground after BoE Governor Carney placed doubts on a May hike last week. AUD, NZD and CAD are subdued amid similar price action in the commodities complex and with CAD despondent from softer than expected CPI data, while JPY remains mostly firmer with JPY-crosses near last week&rsquo;s lows although USD/JPY bucks the trend and is driven by USD outperformance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid spill over selling from USTs and with yields tracking the upside in their US counterparts, which saw the US 10yr print its highest since January 2014 in early Asia trade.</p>\r\n",
