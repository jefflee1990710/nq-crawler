        "content": "<p><strong>4<sup>th</sup> January 2018</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOMC MEETING MINUTES: </strong>The Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes were, on balance, neutral. However, traders seemed to focus on news that a few policymakers noted that median Fed projections published in December would bring too many rate hikes in 2018, but a few others stated that more hikes would be required in 2018 than implied by the projections. Elsewhere, policymakers generally saw medium-term inflation outlook as little changed, though &ldquo;several&rdquo; were concerned that persistently weak inflation may have hampered inflation expectations. Despite an initially muted reaction, USD gained strength and gold ebbed lower with markets likely disregarding the fears of &lsquo;too many hikes in 2018&rsquo; given the upcoming change in composition at the Fed which many view as having a more hawkish tilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES: SPX +0.64% at 2713, DJI +0.4% at 24922, NDX +1% at 6576</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top performers: Energy +1.6%, IT 1.1%, Health Care 1%<br />Bottom performers: Telecom -2.2%, Utilities -0.7%, Consumer Staples -0%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 opened at a fresh record high on Wednesday, and powered through the 2,700 handle shortly afterwards, building on Tuesday&rsquo;s record gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gains were lead by the energy complex, which tracked crude prices higher. Tech stocks were also firm after a number of brokerages upgraded the likes of Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, some of the tech sector&rsquo;s gains were mitigated by Intel (INTC) with reports suggesting that some of their chips had significant design flaws, although the news buoyed some of its competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automakers were also performing well on Wednesday, following the monthly sales updates for December, with the big three reporting numbers slightly better than forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other end of the scale, telecoms were lagging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As on Tuesday, Treasuries were following Bunds in early trade, with curve flattening being seen ahead of the ISM data and FOMC meeting minutes, with real money said to be buying in the long-end. But the Treasury complex ran into sellers after decent ISM Manufacturing data, with 2-year yields rising to a nine-year high.<br />ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Markit/CIPS Cons PMI (Dec) 52.2 vs. Exp. 52.8 (Prev. 53.1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong><br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar got a boost after decent ISM Manufacturing and construction spending. Of particular encouragement was the prices paid sub-component rising strongly, though ahead of this week&rsquo;s payrolls data, the employment sub-index slipped by 2 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The release of the Fed&rsquo;s December meeting minutes had little immediate impact, though in the aftermath of the release, the dollar found some strength against the yen, but gains against other majors were more muted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dollar strength pushed EUR to within 1.20 in wake of the release. The EUR was unable to take advantage of solid German labour market data, and there was little impact from Tuesday&rsquo;s hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny, who echoed the sentiments of ECB&rsquo;s Coeure over the weekend; the message seems to be that policymakers are becoming comfortable in talking about the end of the central bank&rsquo;s QE programme in September 2018 if the Eurozone economy continues to progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pound gave back gains made yesterday, falling towards the 1.35 handle; while most of the underperformance was being attributed to the dollar strength, at the margin, a weaker-than-expected construction PMI contributed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD traders were battling around the 1.25 handle once again, on Wednesday. A reported barrier option at 1.2490, however, remained unbreeched, leaving the currency to trade at c.1.2550 ahead of the Fed&rsquo;s meeting minutes release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other commodity FX couldn&rsquo;t capitalise on higher crude prices: NOK was up by around 0.2% before the release of the Fed&rsquo;s meeting minutes, though AUD and NZD were flat. The former was said to be capped by offers around 0.7850, and more are said to be lurking ahead of 0.79. While the NZD &ndash; which slipped in APAC trade &ndash; continued to hold at levels seen overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmer risk appetite kept the JPY, CHF and XAU negative ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes; after the release, however, the yen weakened further, while gold dropped to $1307, before once again recovering towards $1315.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES: WTI futures settle $1.26 higher at $61.63 per barrel; Brent futures settle $1.26 higher at $61.36 per barrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing tensions in Iran, optimism about the health of the global economy, and expectations that this week&rsquo;s energy inventory data will see crude stocks falling for the seventh straight week helped the crude complex remain above the closely-watched $60/bbl mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, OPEC members supplied 32.47mln BPD in December, according to a newswire poll (Prev. 32.448mln BPD in November), with analysts expecting the Saudis will have cut volumes to 9.95mln BPD, and Libya seeing a fall to 970k BPD. Compliance is expected to remain around 121%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (25 Dec, w/e) -4.992M vs. Exp. -5.300M (Prev. -5.222M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Cushing number (25 Dec, w/e) -2.11M (Prev. 0.07M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly dist. stocks (25 Dec, w/e) 4.272M vs. Exp. 1M (Prev. -2.850M)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly gasoline stk (25 Dec, w/e)&nbsp; 1.87M vs. Exp. 1.9M (Prev. 2.001M)</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: fresh record highs for stocks amid mildly hawkish Fed",
        "content": "<p><strong>FOMC MEETING MINUTES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fed&rsquo;s latest meeting minutes were, on balance, neutral. However, traders seemed to focus on news that a few policymakers noted that median Fed projections published in December would bring too many rate hikes in 2018, but a few others stated that more hikes would be required in 2018 than implied by the projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, policymakers generally saw medium-term inflation outlook as little changed, though &ldquo;several&rdquo; were concerned that persistently weak inflation may have hampered inflation expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite an initially muted reaction, USD gained strength and gold ebbed lower with markets likely disregarding the fears of &lsquo;too many hikes in 2018&rsquo; given the upcoming change in composition at the Fed which many view as having a more hawkish tilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES: SPX +0.64% at 2713, DJI +0.4% at 24922, NDX +1% at 6576</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top performers: Energy +1.6%, IT 1.1%, Health Care 1%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom performers: Telecom -2.2%, Utilities -0.7%, Consumer Staples -0%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 opened at a fresh record high on Wednesday, and powered through the 2,700 handle shortly afterwards, building on Tuesday&rsquo;s record gains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gains were lead by the energy complex, which tracked crude prices higher. Tech stocks were also firm after a number of brokerages upgraded the likes of Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (IBM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, some of the tech sector&rsquo;s gains were mitigated by Intel (INTC) with reports suggesting that some of their chips had significant design flaws, although the news buoyed some of its competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automakers were also performing well on Wednesday, following the monthly sales updates for December, with the big three reporting numbers slightly better than forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other end of the scale, telecoms were lagging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dollar got a boost after decent ISM Manufacturing and construction spending. Of particular encouragement was the prices paid sub-component rising strongly, though ahead of this week&rsquo;s payrolls data, the employment sub-index slipped by 2 points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The release of the Fed&rsquo;s December meeting minutes had little immediate impact, though in the aftermath of the release, the dollar found some strength against the yen, but gains against other majors were more muted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dollar strength pushed EUR to within 1.20 in wake of the release. The EUR was unable to take advantage of solid German labour market data, and there was little impact from Tuesday&rsquo;s hawkish comments from ECB&rsquo;s Nowotny, who echoed the sentiments of ECB&rsquo;s Coeure over the weekend; the message seems to be that policymakers are becoming comfortable in talking about the end of the central bank&rsquo;s QE programme in September 2018 if the Eurozone economy continues to progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pound gave back gains made yesterday, falling towards the 1.35 handle; while most of the underperformance was being attributed to the dollar strength, at the margin, a weaker-than-expected construction PMI contributed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD traders were battling around the 1.25 handle once again, on Wednesday. A reported barrier option at 1.2490, however, remained unbreeched, leaving the currency to trade at c.1.2550 ahead of the Fed&rsquo;s meeting minutes release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other commodity FX couldn&rsquo;t capitalise on higher crude prices: NOK was up by around 0.2% before the release of the Fed&rsquo;s meeting minutes, though AUD and NZD were flat. The former was said to be capped by offers around 0.7850, and more are said to be lurking ahead of 0.79. While the NZD &ndash; which slipped in APAC trade &ndash; continued to hold at levels seen overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmer risk appetite kept the JPY, CHF and XAU negative ahead of the FOMC&rsquo;s meeting minutes; after the release, however, the yen weakened further, while gold dropped to $1307, before once again recovering towards $1315.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME: US 10Y T-Note future settles +3 ticks at 123&#39;25</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As on Tuesday, Treasuries were following Bunds in early trade, with curve flattening being seen ahead of the ISM data and FOMC meeting minutes, with real money said to be buying in the long-end. But the Treasury complex ran into sellers after decent ISM Manufacturing data, with 2-year yields rising to a nine-year high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES: WTI futures settle $1.26 higher at $61.63 per barrel; Brent futures settle $1.26 higher at $61.36 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing tensions in Iran, optimism about the health of the global economy, and expectations that this week&rsquo;s energy inventory data will see crude stocks falling for the seventh straight week helped the crude complex remain above the closely-watched $60/bbl mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the bell, the API will release its energy inventory data, and analysts expect to see headline crude stocks draw by 5.3mln barrels. Stocks at Cushing are seen drawing by 2.35mln barrels according to Genscape data. Products, meanwhile, are seen building, with distillates forecast to add 1.0mln barrels to stocks, while gasoline is expected to show a build to 1.9mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traders were also citing data out of Brazil, which showed crude oil output declining by 1.2% in November. And elsewhere, a gas pipeline fire in Nigeria also gave traders reasons to avoid selling in the energy complex, some reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, OPEC members supplied 32.47mln BPD in December, according to a newswire poll (Prev. 32.448mln BPD in November), with analysts expecting the Saudis will have cut volumes to 9.95mln BPD, and Libya seeing a fall to 970k BPD. Compliance is expected to remain around 121%.</p>\r\n",

On the flip-side, 112.00 and a tad above provides solid support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both weaker vs the Greenback, with the Loonie unable to build on recent gains to seriously test support through 1.2500 and 1.2490 option barriers despite firmer oil prices, while Usd/Chf almost rebounded to 0.9800.</p>\r\n",

The price action certainly indicates that stops prompted a more pronounced short squeeze, and Gilts extended their rebound to 124.75 (+53 ticks) before running out of steam almost as quickly/abruptly. Regardless, the core Eurex debt future has reversed all and a bit more of Tuesday&rsquo;s drop despite bumper investor demand for Ireland&rsquo;s 10 year syndicated offering and a more emphatic recovery in peripheral paper, with MiFID 2 low turnover exacerbating moves.</p>\r\n",

Korea engage in dialogue</li>\r\n  <li>European equities rise modestly; positive trading update from Next helps lift other retailers</li>\r\n  <li>Highlights include the FOMC minutes, US ISM Manufacturing and US auto sales</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Major Asian indices gained on Wednesday, with investors cheering the strong start to 2018 seen on Wall Street. Miners supported the ASX 200 (+0.2%), which comes amid Australia&rsquo;s metals and mining index hovered at its best level in 5 years following the rise in metal prices with gold firmly above USD 1300, alongside the recent rally in zinc (zinc hit a 10-year high on Tuesday) . Chinese bourses initially conformed to the upbeat tone before Hong Kong shares ebbed lower (Shanghai Comp +0.6%, Hang Seng +0.1%), with focus also on the PBoC&rsquo;s actions whereby they strengthened the CNY fix by the most since May 2016, where USDCNY fell below 6.50. Japanese markets remained closed and will reopen on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No major US stories of note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>German Unemployment Change SA (Dec) -29k vs. Exp. -12k (Prev. -18k, Rev. -20k)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>German Unemployment Rate SA (Dec) 5.5% vs. Exp. 5.6% (Prev. 5.6%, Rev. 5.5%)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK Markit/CIPS Construction PMI (Dec) 52.2 vs. Exp. 52.8 (Prev. 53.1)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>President Trump tweeted that he too has a nuclear button, which is a much bigger and more powerful one than Kim Jong Un&#39;s and that his button works.

(CNBC)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have seen a modest bounce-back from yesterday&rsquo;s losses to trade mostly higher across the board (Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%). The only outlier has been the FTSE 100 (flat) which has been unable to join the party as recent GBP gains have kept potential moves to the upside capped. This also comes in spite of strong performance in UK retail names with Next (+7.1%) top of the leaderboard after an encouraging sales update and raising guidance; subsequently supporting the likes of Marks &amp; Spencer and Associated British Foods (owner of Primark). Elsewhere, tech names are also seen higher in a continuation of sentiment seen on Wall Street yesterday, energy names have also been supported after oil prices hit 2015 highs yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY has maintained recovery gains above Tuesday&rsquo;s circa 91.750 3 month low, but the Index has not managed to reclaim the 92.000 handle and therefore looks prime for further losses without any additional support/momentum, which could come via tonight&rsquo;s FOMC minutes and/or the first official monthly BLS report of the year on Friday. Elsewhere, GBP marginally outperforming as Cable edges towards 1.3600 (no impact from UK construction PMI miss), while Aud/Usd and Nzd/Usd are both off yesterday&rsquo;s peaks. 0.7850 continues to cap the former pair, and the Kiwi is sitting right on its 200 DMA (0.7105-10) after just failing to reach/breach strong resistance around 0.7132 on Tuesday. Eur/Usd has not really benefited from better than expected German data and remains around 1.2040, with 1.2092 (2017 high). Usd/Jpy contained within another tight range with 112.00 and key chart support just above still being respected, while light offers around 112.40 are noted ahead of bigger sell orders between 112.60-70.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds have reclaimed a bit more lost ground to reach 161.45, with market contacts seeing bids above 161.35 from short term/intraday traders looking for a 50% retracement of Tuesday&rsquo;s sell-off, which equates to 161.48 &ndash; so arguably realised give or take a few ticks. 161.53 represents the next upside pivot, with buy-stops anticipated on a break for a re-test of Tuesday&rsquo;s opening Eurex peak (161.78), but above forecast German jobs data may have scuppered any prospect of a further rebound. From a bearish chart angle, 161.18 is still on the radar, while Gilts rather belatedly got a boost from their core Eurozone peer to hit 124.44 (+22 ticks vs -16 ticks at worst) and could maintain recovery momentum on the back of another UK PMI miss, although this was not the case after the manufacturing headline confounded expectations yesterday, in fact far from it. The 2 EU benchmarks are currently around 161.35 and 124.35, corresponding 10 year yields approx 0.46% and 1.27% respectively. Peripheral spreads are tighter with Italy leading the way (4.5bps tighter), followed by Spain (4bps), Portugal (1bps) and France (1bps). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, both WTI and Brent crude futures are seen in modest positive territory ahead of today&rsquo;s delayed API release. In terms of energy newsflow, things remain light with markets continuing to keep an eye on events in Tehran (albeit Iran denies any impact on their production/export levels). In metals markets, gold has taken a breather from recent advances after hitting 3 &frac12; month highs with prices broadly tracking movements in the USD. Elsewhere, base metals were also seen lower with some analysts citing adverse weather conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exxon&#39;s Baytown, Texas refinery (the 2nd largest in US) reports emissions from delayed coker unit restart.

Eur/Usd has not really benefited from better than expected German data in the form of December unemployment and remains around 1.2040, with 1.2092 (2017 high) still keeping bulls in check, while a decent option expiry at 1.2030 (950 mn) may also be weighing. Usd/Jpy contained within another tight range with 112.00 and key chart support just above still being respected, while light offers around 112.40 are noted ahead of bigger sell orders between 112.60-70. Usd/Cad and Usd/Chf both holding just above big figure levels (1.2500 and 0.9700 respectively), but the Loonie underpinned by firm oil prices and Franc in wake of a firmer than expected Swiss manufacturing PMI.</p>\r\n",

Antipodeans, in particular <strong>NZD underperformed with the currency circa 10-20pips off the 0.71 handle</strong>, having met resistance at 200 DMA of 0.7107, which also represents the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the September/November decline. AUD had dipped also in line with the slight pullback in precious metals, before finding support just north of the 0.78 figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Precious metals saw a slight pullback in Asian trade with gold slipping some USD 3/oz, silver also took a mild dip to move within close proximity to USD 17/oz. WTI and Brent crude futures very quiet with oil prices trading sideways overnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exxon&#39;s Baytown, Texas refinery which is the 2nd largest in US reports emissions from delayed coker unit.

Nevertheless, the major curves steepened, with the 2s10s spread up by c.3bps at settlement, 5s30s c.3bps wider, and 2s30s c.5bps steeper.</p>\r\n",
