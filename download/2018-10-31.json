Corporate earnings were also positive (FB AMC on Tuesday). Following their recent losses, the FAANG stocks bounced higher after Facebook (FB) moved higher today on the back of its strong earnings and mentioning its margins would stop shrinking in the year ahead, as well as Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) both trading higher. Financials made gains too after the Fed said it would loosen regulation on banks with under USD 700bln in assets, top movers included SVB Financial (SIVB) and Regions Financial (RF). General Electric (GE) also surged higher following strong EPS figures and full year guidance. Kellogg (K) was a bottom mover after revising its profit forecast lower, this had a wider effect on the packaged food industry where General Mills (GIS), Kraft Heinz (KHZ) and Campbell Soup (CPB) were all down. Gilead Sciences (GILD) traded lower on the back of a partnership with Tango Therapeutics. Earnings from Electronic Arts (EA) saw its revenue miss estimates making it another one of the day&rsquo;s bottom movers. SPX +1.08% at 2712, NDX +2.31% at 6967, DJI +0.97% at 25116.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The global risk-on theme resulted in lower Treasury prices, with yields rising by between 3-4bps at settlement. The bias was towards a slightly, slightly steeper curve, though the moves were modest at best at beneath 1bps. A solid ADP report helped support the rise in yields. In its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it will sell USD 37bln in 3yr, USD 27bln in 10yr and USD 19bln in 30yr notes, all in line with expectations, and is to offer a new 5yr TIPS in Oct. 2019. Wells Fargo suggests that there are three key takeaways from today&#39;s refunding announcement: &quot;First, it appears Treasury is fairly comfortable with how the nominal coupon auction schedule is shaping up to meet the FY 2019 financing needs. Second, Treasury remains committed to keeping total bills outstanding on an upward trajectory. Finally, even with the smaller increases to nominal coupon auctions than we expected, there will likely still be an onslaught of net coupon issuance in CY 2019&quot;. US T-notes futures (Z8) settled 11 ticks lower at 118-14.</p>\r\n",

While he noted that progress was being made and most issues had been resolved, he reiterated that both sides were of the view that the backstop cannot provide for permanent UK/EU relationship after Brexit, suggesting that the issue of the Irish border remains unresolved. Nevertheless, GBP found a bid on the news, though was faded as the market found few new details to stick their teeth into. In response to the announcement, Irish Foreign Minister Coveney said it is possible to get a Brexit deal in November though it is up to Britain in particular to intensify negotiations towards a deal; he added they will hold a summit on November 21st and urged a signal from negotiating teams as early as next week. A spokesperson for the UK government later said that there was no set date for the negotiations to conclude. Elsewhere, UK PM May and Chancellor Hammond are said to have given a positive Brexit update to business leaders, though fresh detail was not forthcoming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Il Sole 24 Ore reported that Italy may argue that the effective deficit is to be nearer to 2%; similarly Finance Minister Tria reassured that the deficit/GDP target will not go above the target of 2.4% in 2019 while reiterating the Italian government has no plans to leave the Euro. He added that a bank rescue would be implemented respecting current laws and that neither Banca Carige or Banca Popolare Bari are failing or likely to fail. ECB&rsquo;s Visco stressed Italy cannot narrow growth gap with the EU with higher spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Nowotny (hawkish) said he assumes monetary policy normalisation steps will be carried out as announced, including the end of bond purchases at year end. He has not seen anything that would require an adjustment to monetary policy. ECB&#39;s Hansson (hawk) stated he will not draw big conclusions from the prelim release of Eurozone Q3 GDP; ECB&#39;s Rehn (neutral) also commented on the latest figures noting the economic deceleration in Q3 is partly temporary and he is confident in a mild rebound in growth in Q4. On inflation, he said it is gradually converging to target; he added prospects for returning to conventional rates and balance sheet have strengthened and emphasised gradualism. Note that Eurozone GDP Flash Prelim came in at 0.2%, a tad below the 0.4% consensus. ECB&#39;s De Cos said wage pick up should lead to inflation recovery over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ADP NATIONAL EMPLOYMENT </strong>added 227k private jobs in October, well above the expected 189k, representing only a small fall from the previous 230k which was downwardly revised to 218k. This is a strong report consistent with the solid labour demand depicted in recent surveys. Nonetheless this may not be a clear indication of Friday&rsquo;s official number since ADP does not capture impacts from adverse weather conditions, specifically of Hurricane Florence, analysts at Pantheon note. Therefore, they would be very surprised to see NFP coming in as strong as ADP this month. Elsewhere, employment costs rose 0.8% from 0.6%. slightly above the 0.7% consensus, led by a 0.9% advance in wages; private sector wages are currently up 3.1% for the year representing the strongest pace. On the flip side, benefit costs moderated. Analysts at Wells Fargo expects compensation costs to increase further over the next year as businesses seek to boost wages and as the labour markets tightens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN GDP </strong>rose by 0.1% MM in August, beating expectations for n unchanged reading. &quot;Growth was primarily driven by services, though a rebound in oil production helped offset weakness elsewhere in the goods sector,&quot; TD Securities said. July&#39;s data saw downward revisions, which weighed on TD&#39;s growth tracker, (tracks Q3 growth of 2.0% now). The knee-jerk reaction was for USDCAD to fall, though the strength was not sustained, &quot;as the details provide little to be enthused about,&quot; TD wrote; the bank sees CAD remaining in a 1.28-1.32 range and says that the fair value is situated closer to the upper bound of that range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> NEC Director Kudlow says he is not sure that an agenda for the China President Xi-US President Trump trade meeting at the G20 has been worked out; but adds the two will meet at the G20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +1.08% at 2712, NDX +2.31% at 6967, DJI +0.97% at 25116. SECTORS: </strong>Energy +0.60%, Materials +1.35%, Industrials +0.81%, Cons Discretionary +1.63%, Cons Staples -0.86%, Healthcare +0.19%, Financials +1.43%, Tech +2.39%, Telecoms +2.10%, Utilities -1.16%. Stocks surged on Wednesday, lead by tech shares, with month-end rebalancing said to provide some support. Corporate earnings were also positive (FB AMC on Tuesday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Following their recent losses, the FAANG stocks bounced higher after Facebook (FB) moved higher today on the back of its strong earnings and mentioning its margins would stop shrinking in the year ahead, as well as Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) both trading higher. Financials made gains too after the Fed said it would loosen regulation on banks with under USD 700bln in assets, top movers included SVB Financial (SIVB) and Regions Financial (RF). General Electric (GE) also surged higher following strong EPS figures and full year guidance. Kellogg (K) was a bottom mover after revising its profit forecast lower, this had a wider effect on the packaged food industry where General Mills (GIS), Kraft Heinz (KHZ) and Campbell Soup (CPB) were all down. Gilead Sciences (GILD) traded lower on the back of a partnership with Tango Therapeutics. Earnings from Electronic Arts (EA) saw its revenue miss estimates making it another one of the day&rsquo;s bottom movers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Z8) SETTLES $0.97 LOWER AT $65.31/BBL, BRENT (Z8, EXPIRES) SETTLES $0.44 LOWER AT $75.47/BBL. </strong>Early crude weakness on Wednesday was attributed to softer PMI data out of China, where the official manufacturing PMI fell to the lowest since July 2016, which saw oil traders re-focus on hints of a global slowdown. USD strength also acted as a headwind. Crude inventory data showed a smaller than expected build (3.22mln vs expected 4.11mln), Cushing stocks built in line with expectations at 1.88mln; the products drew down by more than expected (gasoline -3.16mln vs -2.14mln expected; distillates -4.05mln vs expected -1.37mln); the net drawdown of crude products helped lift oil, though the complex struggled to sustain gains. Crude production, meanwhile, rose by 2.75% in the week to a record 11.2mln BPD. There was also talk of some position squaring as Brent Z18 expires. On the geopolitical front, US national security advisor Bolton said a number of countries might not be able to cut Iranian crude imports to zero, adding that while the US wants to apply maximum pressure on Iran, it does not want to harm friends and allies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 11 TICKS LOWER AT 118-14. </strong>The global risk-on theme resulted in lower Treasury prices, with yields rising by between 3-4bps at settlement. The bias was towards a slightly, slightly steeper curve, though the moves were modest at best at beneath 1bps. A solid ADP report hlped support the rise in yields. In its quarterly refunding announcement, the US Treasury said it will sell USD 37bln in 3yr, USD 27bln in 10yr and USD 19bln in 30yr notes, all in line with expectations, and is to offer a new 5yr TIPS in Oct. 2019. Wells Fargo suggests that there are three key takeaways from today&#39;s refunding announcement: &quot;First, it appears Treasury is fairly comfortable with how the nominal coupon auction schedule is shaping up to meet the FY 2019 financing needs. Second, Treasury remains committed to keeping total bills outstanding on an upward trajectory. Finally, even with the smaller increases to nominal coupon auctions than we expected, there will likely still be an onslaught of net coupon issuance in CY 2019.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Another session of gains for the USD with the DXY remaining above the 97.00 level and reaching its highest level in around 16 months. Newsflow was relatively light throughout the session with a bulk of the price action more likely a by-product of month-end positioning and markets being mindful of SOMA redemptions with a net liquidity impact of USD -22.9bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>This subsequently set the tone throughout the market with EUR/USD&rsquo;s initial resilience towards Friday&rsquo;s lows of 1.1336 relatively short-lived as prices were dragged to a low of 1.1303(!) and in close proximity to YTD lows around the psychological 1.1300 level. On the data front, Eurozone inflation showed signs of a mild pick-up in underlying inflation with both core and super-core metrics exceeding expectations. Furthermore, ECB-hawk Hansson warned markets not to read too much into the prelim reading of Q3 EZ GDP but his optimism was not enough to stop the rot in EUR/USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> GBP bucked the trend and was resilient to the USD&rsquo;s gains after failing to make a convincing break below 1.2700. Cable saw a surge halfway through the session with little in the way of fundamental catalysts behind the move and managed to make a high print of 1.2779. All eyes are now on events at the BoE and how the Bank views the balance between encouraging wage growth and Brexit uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD:</strong> Elsewhere, AUD was also softer vs. the USD in the wake of domestic inflation metrics whereby all figures either missed or printed in-line with estimates and which was below the RBA&rsquo;s 2%-3% target range. The data sent AUD/USD back below 0.7100 with Chinese PMI readings thereafter guiding the pair to session lows of 0.7073.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>USD/JPY was lifted by a combination of USD strength and the general risk environment with global equity markets firmer across the board. The pair has been supported throughout the week and for now appears to be guided by broader market themes rather than domestic events whereby today&rsquo;s latest policy announcement from the BoJ did little to move the JPY in what was an unsurprising release from the Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMs: </strong>One to watch in the EM-space over the coming sessions could well be the INR after the Rupee faced selling pressure overnight amid a widening rift between the RBI and government with reports noting that Governor Patel may consider resigning; reports briefly pushed USD/INR above the 74.00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: </strong>Bank of England Monetary Policy Decision, Minutes and Quarterly Inflation Report 1st November 2018. MPC expected to vote 9-0 in favour of standing pat on rates at 0.75%. Economic data has been mixed since the last MPC meeting in September with encouraging wage data offset by disappointing growth and inflation prospects. Brexit progress has been particularly muted since the previous meeting with policymakers hopes of an October deal dashed by ongoing stalemate. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20443/download\">Click here for the full RANsquawk preview</a>.</p>\r\n",

USD strength also acted as a headwind. Crude inventory data showed a smaller than expected build (3.22mln vs expected 4.11mln), Cushing stocks built in line with expectations at 1.88mln; the products drew down by more than expected (gasoline -3.16mln vs -2.14mln expected; distillates -4.05mln vs expected -1.37mln); the net drawdown of crude products helped lift oil, though the complex struggled to sustain gains. Crude production, meanwhile, rose by 2.75% in the week to a record 11.2mln BPD. There was also talk of some position squaring as Brent Z18 expires. On the geopolitical front, US national security advisor Bolton said a number of countries might not be able to cut Iranian crude imports to zero, adding that while the US wants to apply maximum pressure on Iran, it does not want to harm friends and allies.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Another session of gains for the USD with the DXY making a more convincing break of the 97.00 level to the upside during EU trade to reach its highest level in around 16 months. Newsflow was relatively light throughout the session with a bulk of the price action more likely a by-product of month-end positioning and markets being mindful of SOMA redemptions with a net liquidity impact of USD -22.9bln due today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This subsequently set the tone throughout the market with EUR/USD&rsquo;s initial resilience towards Friday&rsquo;s lows of 1.1336 relatively short-lived as prices were dragged to a low of 1.1311 and in close proximity to YTD lows around the psychological 1.1300 level. On the data front, Eurozone inflation showed signs of a mild pick-up in underlying inflation with both core and super-core metrics exceeding expectations. Furthermore, ECB-hawk Hansson warned markets not to read too much into the prelim reading of Q3 EZ GDP but his optimism was not enough to stop the rot in EUR/USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP bucked the trend and was resilient to the USD&rsquo;s gains after failing to make a convincing break below 1.2700. Cable saw a surge halfway through the session with little in the way of fundamental catalysts behind the move and managed to make a high print of 1.2779. All eyes are now on events at the BoE and how the Bank views the balance between encouraging wage growth and Brexit uncertainty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, AUD was also softer vs. the USD in the wake of domestic inflation metrics whereby all figures either missed or printed in-line with estimates and which was below the RBA&rsquo;s 2%-3% target range. The data sent AUD/USD back below 0.7100 with Chinese PMI readings thereafter guiding the pair to session lows of 0.7073.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/JPY was lifted by a combination of USD strength and the general risk environment with global equity markets firmer across the board. The pair has been supported throughout the week and for now appears to be guided by broader market themes rather than domestic events whereby today&rsquo;s latest policy announcement from the BoJ did little to move the JPY in what was an unsurprising release from the Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One to watch in the EM-space over the coming sessions could well be the INR after the Rupee faced selling pressure overnight amid a widening rift between the RBI and government with reports noting that Governor Patel may consider resigning; reports briefly pushed USD/INR above the 74.00 level.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.2%) were higher from the open with financials the early outperformer in Australia after ANZ Bank earnings and with CBA to offload its funds unit for over AUD 4.1bln, while Japanese stocks were underpinned by a weaker currency and with focus on a slew of earnings releases. Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) conformed to the overall risk appetite as investors digested earnings including big 4 lenders ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China, but with early indecision seen following uninspiring Chinese PMI data in which both Official Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI fell short of estimates. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower with demand subdued by the strong performance in Japanese stocks and following an unsurprising BoJ policy announcement in which the central bank maintained all policy settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 150bln, while it announced to sell CNY 10bln in 3-month and CNY 10bln in 1yr CNY-denominated bills in Hong Kong on November 7th. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9646 (Prev. 6.9574)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Manufacturing PMI (Oct) 50.2 vs. Exp. 50.6 (Prev. 50.8).

Furthermore, the decision on YCC was made by 7-2 vote with Kataoka and Harada the dissenters again, while the BoJ cut Core CPI forecasts in its Outlook Report and stated that risks to economic outlook and prices are skewed to the downside. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Governor Kuroda said JGB yields are starting to respond more to moves in yields overseas, adding that inflation expectations are largely flat but upward price momentum remains. Furthermore, he stated that the BoJ&rsquo;s monetary easing is not targeting FX markets and will take steps on JGB market functioning if needed; lowering rates, expanding monetary base and increasing asset purchases are amongst the bank&rsquo;s options.

France&rsquo;s CAC 40 (+1.9%) outperforms its peers with the index fuelled by gains in heavyweights L&rsquo;Oreal (+5.4%) and Sanofi (+5.0%) post-earnings. In terms of sectors, energy names lead the gains as the complex retraces yesterday&rsquo;s losses, while utility names underperform.

        "content": "<p>After breaching 97.00 to the upside overnight to hit its highest level since June 2017, the DXY has paused for breath and is now back on a 96.00 handle. USD will likely garner a bulk of the focus in the FX space today with month-end flows (as according to Barclays, Citi, Nordea and Credit Ag) said to be positive for the greenback. Furthermore, Nordea highlight that today is SOMA redemption day for the USD which will have a net USD -22.9bln impact on liquidity; Nordea explains that &ldquo;On the ten SOMA days since the end of February, EUR/USD has always been lower at CET17:15 vs CET08:00, by an average of 0.25%&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of where the majors stand vs. the USD, EUR/USD trades slightly higher thus far after bouncing off Friday&rsquo;s low at 1.1336. That said, with the aforementioned potential for a firmer USD, a test of 1.1300 to the downside could well be on the cards ahead of EZ CPI metrics this morning. Option expiry activity for the pair could be a guiding force later on with 871mln due 1.1275-85, 2.2bln between 1.1300-25 and a further 1.47bln between 1.1340-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, GBP has been granted some mild reprieve after briefly breaching 1.2700 to the downside yesterday with GBP/USD high print for the session at 1.2752. Brexit-related commentary has been relatively light for the session thus far with attention potentially due to fall on events at the BoE tomorrow. Markets will brace themselves for how the MPC balance the opposing forces of recent data vs. the ongoing uncertainty posed by Brexit; The Times Shadow MPC have voted in favour of lifting rates. A overtly cautious BoE could spark the next wave of GBP selling with yearly lows of 1.2660 carefully watched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD remains softer vs. the USD in the wake of domestic inflation metrics whereby all figures either missed or printed in-line with estimates and which was below the RBA&rsquo;s 2%-3% target range. The data sent AUD/USD back below 0.7100 with Chinese PMI readings thereafter guiding the pair to session lows of 0.7073 before staging a mild recovery back towards the 0.71 handle. Elsewhere for the region, USD/JPY trades relatively unchanged as the risk environment outweighs mild USD softness; prices trade in close proximity to the 113.00 handle and just below 1.3bln in expiries at 113.10-20.0</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, focus during the Asia-Pac session also fell on the INR which faced some selling pressure amid a widening rift between the RBI and government with reports noting that Governor Patel may consider resigning; reports briefly pushed USD/INR above the 74.00 level.</p>\r\n",

Hang Seng (+1.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.6%) conformed to the overall risk appetite as investors digested earnings including big 4 lenders ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China, but with early indecision seen following uninspiring Chinese PMI data in which both Official Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI fell short of estimates. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower with demand subdued by the strong performance in Japanese stocks and following an unsurprising BoJ policy announcement in which the central bank maintained all policy settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net daily drain of CNY 150bln, while it announced to sell CNY 10bln in 3-month and CNY 10bln in 1yr CNY-denominated bills in Hong Kong on November 7th. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.9646 (Prev. 6.9574)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Manufacturing PMI (Oct) 50.2 vs. Exp. 50.6 (Prev. 50.8). (Newswires)<br />Chinese Non-Manufacturing PMI (Oct) 53.9 vs. Exp. 54.9 (Prev. 54.9)<br />Chinese Composite PMI (Oct) 53.1 (Prev. 54.1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ kept monetary policy settings unchanged as expected with NIRP held at -0.1% and 10yr JGB yield target at around 0%, while it also maintained pledge to buy JGBs in a flexible manner so holdings increase at annual pace of around JPY 80tln and reiterated forward guidance to keep rates at extremely low level for an extended period. Furthermore, the decision on YCC was made by 7-2 vote with Kataoka and Harada the dissenters again, while the BoJ cut Core CPI forecasts in its Outlook Report and stated that risks to economic outlook and prices are skewed to the downside. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK GfK Consumer Confidence Oct -10 vs. Exp. -10.0 (Prev. -9.0). (Newswires)<br />UK BRC Shop Price Index (Oct) Y/Y -0.2% Prev. 0.2%)<br />UK Lloyds Business Barometer (Oct) M/M 19 (Prev. 29)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoE should hike interest rates at this week&rsquo;s policy meeting to offset the chancellor&rsquo;s inflationary budget spending spree, according The Times Shadow MPC. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s Treasury said EU asked for clarification on plans to reduce debt and that they will respond to EU questions on debt reduction by November 13th. Furthermore, the EU said Italy&#39;s public debt remains a key vulnerability and a cause of concern for the whole euro zone, while EU added Italy&#39;s planned fiscal expansion is not compatible with the debt cut. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX<br /><br />The USD took a breather from recent gains with the DXY flat around the 97.00 level after it hit the highest since June last year amid the continued rout in EUR/USD and GBP/USD, with the latter testing 1.2700 to the downside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses extended on advances amid alongside the heightened risk appetite, while antipodeans were subdued with AUD/USD pressured by a softer PBoC fix, Chinese PMI disappointment and Australian CPI data which either missed or printed inline with estimates and which was below the RBA&rsquo;s 2%-3% target range. INR also lagged due to a widening rift between the RBI and government with reports noting that Governor Patel may consider resigning which briefly pushed USD/INR above the 74.00 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian CPI (Q3) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.4%). (Newswires)<br />Australian CPI (Q3) Y/Y 1.9% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 2.1%)<br />Australian RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (Q3) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.4% (Prev. 0.5%)<br />Australian RBA Trimmed Mean CPI (Q3) Y/Y 1.8% vs. Exp. 1.9% (Prev. 1.9%)<br /><br />BoC Governor Poloz said it is appropriate that the pace of future rate increases &#39;will depend on our assessment at each fixed announcement date&#39; and reiterated that policy rate will need to rise to neutral to achieve inflation target with the neutral rate estimated between 2.5%-3.5%. However, BoC Governor Poloz also commented that if we move too quickly with rate hikes, economy will slow below potential growth rate which is not wanted. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC&#39;s Wilkins said if there is ever a time to revert back to normal interest rates, it is during this period. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexican President Elect Obrador said the MXN will recover after &quot;slipping&quot; due to Monday&#39;s decision to cancel the semi-built Mexico City Airport. (Newswires)<br /><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight with WTI crude marginally higher despite the larger than expected build in API crude inventories as gasoline and distillate stockpiles both showed wider than anticipated drawdowns, while some analysts recently suggested that OPEC+ producers were mulling a potential reduction of output in November. Elsewhere, gold remained pressured as the greenback held steady at 16-month highs, while copper failed to benefit from the positive risk tone as prices languished near 6-week lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (26 Oct) +5.69mln vs. Exp. +3.7mln (Prev. +9.88mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC+ is mulling the option of cutting output in November after the US elections, according to analysts at Energy Intelligence. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In European trade, the treasury complex found some buyers after Italy suggested the GDP slowdown is an additional reason for the budget expansion. Nonetheless, in US hours, a strong US consumer confidence and an improving risk-sentiment reversed those moves, with the complex ending Tuesday&rsquo;s session in negative territory. Yields were higher by c.2bps across the curve at settlement. 2s5s narrowed by c.1bps whilst 5s30s were wider by c.1bps. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 5+ ticks lower at 118-25.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The BoJ will conclude its latest 2-day policy meeting on Wednesday in which no major fireworks are anticipated given the one-sided expectations for the central bank to maintain its policy settings of negative rates at -0.1% and the long-term yield target at around 0.0%. In addition, the BoJ is expected to keep its flexible approach on yields and reaffirm its forward guidance of keeping current extremely low rates for an extended period of time, while the central bank will also release its latest Outlook Report containing board members&#39; median forecasts for Real GDP and Core CPI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rhetoric from the central bank continues to suggest an unlikelihood for any near-term shift to a tightening cycle as Governor Kuroda has often reiterated they will maintain QQE with YCC for as long as needed to reach the price goal, while Kuroda also stated the BoJ will not adjust monetary policy with inflation still half-way through the 2% inflation target which he also noted would take longer than expected to achieve. Furthermore, board member Sakurai reiterated the central bank needs to continue with easing persistently for the time being and even suggested that BoJ forecasts of Japanese economic growth could be revised lower depending on how protectionism and capital outflows from EMs spread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest data also supports the case for BoJ to refrain from any tightening shift as headline National CPI printed softer than expected at 1.2% vs. Exp. 1.3% (Prev. 1.3%) and with Core CPI just about at the halfway point to the target at 1.0% vs. Exp. 1.0% (Prev. 0.9%). The recent Tankan survey was also a disappointment and showed business sentiment deteriorated for a 3rd consecutive quarter with the headline Large Manufacturers Index at 19 vs. Exp. 22.0 (Prev. 21.0) and Large All Industry Capex at 13.4% vs. Exp. 14.2% (Preview. 13.6%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other factors that add to the BoJ&#39;s reluctance for policy adjustments include the on-going uncertainties regarding the US-China trade dispute and its spill-over effects into the global economy as both sides seem unwilling to backdown. Some are also concerned Japan could be next in the US&#39; sights considering Trump&#39;s propensity to not shy away from taking aim at allies, while next year&#39;s scheduled sales tax hike and its likely impact on growth also restricts scope for tightening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no exact release time for the BoJ policy announcement which tends to be anytime after the start of the Tokyo lunch break at 0230GMT/2130CDT. Aside from the actual policy announcement, participants will be eyeing any changes to the voting composition regarding the decision on YCC which was made 7-2 vote at the September meeting with board members Kataoka and Harada the regular dissenters. Focus will also be on the latest forecasts in the Outlook Report and on any surprise announcements as source reports recently suggested the BoJ were eyeing tweaks to the bond buying programme but were in no rush to make adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previous Outlook Report Forecasts:<br /><br />Real GDP<br />- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.5%.<br />- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 0.8%.<br />- Fiscal 2020 forecast at 0.8%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Core CPI<br />- Fiscal 2018 forecast at 1.1%.<br />- Fiscal 2019 forecast at 1.5% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).<br />- Fiscal 2020 forecast at 1.6% (excluding effects of sales tax hike).</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (Unch) and Nikkei 225 (+1.6%) were higher from the open with financials outperforming in Australia after ANZ Bank earnings and with CBA to offload its funds unit for over AUD 4.1bln, while Japanese stocks are underpinned by a weaker currency and with focus also on a slew of earnings releases. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.1%) conform to the overall risk appetite with investors digesting earnings including big 4 lenders ICBC and Agricultural Bank of China, but with early indecision seen following uninspiring Chinese PMI data in which both Official Manufacturing PMI and Non-Manufacturing PMI fell short of estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the USD is flat as it takes a breather from recent gains with the DXY just about holding on to the 97.00 level after having hit its highest since June last year amid the continued rout in EUR/USD and GBP/USD, with the latter testing 1.2700 to the downside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses extend on advances amid the heightened risk appetite, while antipodeans are subdued with AUD/USD pressured by softer PBoC fix, Chinese PMI disappointment and Australian CPI data which either missed or printed inline with estimates and was also below the RBA&rsquo;s 2%-3% target range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower with demand subdued by the strong performance in Japanese stocks and with participants sidelined ahead of today&rsquo;s BoJ policy announcement.</p>\r\n",
