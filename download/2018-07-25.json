This was then confirmed in a joint press conference in which US President Trump stated that the US is launching a phase of close friendship with the EU and that they agreed to work on zero tariffs, barriers and subsidies on non-auto industrial goods. Furthermore, Trump stated EU has agreed to buy more US soybeans and that they will resolve steel and aluminium tariffs, while Trump also stated there will be no new tariffs against EU after parties agreed to trade negotiations and will work together to reform the WTO.

Along with news that Senate was introducing a bipartisan bill to prevent Trump applying auto tariffs under national security rules propelled the ES to the highest since February. As the second busiest day of earnings season kicked off, Boeing (BA) beat on top and bottom line, however it forecast its FY core EPS below Wall St. expectations, this resulted in the DJI underperforming the US today as the name accounts for 10% of the index. Auto names were hit after earnings from General Motors (GM), shares fell by the most since 2011 today whose EPS missed expectations and they cut their FY Adj. EPS forecast to $6 from $6.41 due to higher steel and aluminium costs. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) also reported figures where its adjusted EBIT came in lower than expectations, FCAU also cut its revenue guidance. The combination of the two added pressure to its competitors, with the likes of Volkswagen (VOW3 GY) who closed the EU session with losses of 2.7%, Ford (F) were also hit ahead of their earnings tonight at 21:15 BST / 16:15 EST. Coca Cola (KO) led the Dow after its numbers beat on both ends as its diet drinks sales increased, however it did note revenues were hit with a 15% headwind after the refranchising of its company owned bottling operations. AT&amp;T (T) reported AMC on Tuesday and the name hit a 6 year low as its revenue missed estimates and were also lower by 2% on a y/y basis, however it forecasts its 2018 adjusted EPS in the high $3.50 range, above expectations of $3.44. SPX +0.91% at 2846, NDX +1.38% at 7508, DJI +0.68% at 25414.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The US Treasury sold USD 36bln of 5-year notes in a decent sale which saw a stop-through of 1bps, and better participation from indirects. The curve was mixed on Wednesday, with 2-year yields printing fresh near-decade highs ahead of next week&rsquo;s FOMC. US new home sales data garnered little price action, with traders opting to keep their powder dry ahead of the Trump/Juncker meeting. The curve continued to flatten, with 2s30s narrow by around 3bps at settlement, 2s5s flatter by slightly less than that, while other major curve spread were narrower modestly. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 3 ticks higher at 119-21.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "(Early) US MARKET WRAP – 25 July 2018: Europe said to make concessions on trade with the US",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities up, Treasuries flatter, crude up, dollar down.<br />* REAR-VIEW: &nbsp;Trump/Juncker make positive comments on trade pre-meeting; US Senators have introduced a bipartisan bill to delay auto tariffs until a study has been completed; EIA reports big crude draw, US new home sales plunge.<br />* COMING-UP: AMC earnings from QCOM, V, PYPL, F; Thursday&rsquo;s ECB rate decision, Thursday BMO earnings from AMZN, INTC, MA, CMCSA.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Before US President Trump and EU&rsquo;s Juncker met to discuss trade, Trump said he was hopeful that something can be worked out on a fair trade deal with Europe, adding that the US wants, at minimum, reciprocal trade with its Allies, and he was expecting something positive on trade at the meeting. Juncker said that the EU and the US are allies, not enemies, and that the two will focus on reducing tariffs not increasing them. At the same time, it was reported that US Senators have introduced a bipartisan bill to delay auto tariffs until a study has been completed. The positivity from Trump/Juncker combined with the headline from Senate helped stoke risk sentiment, pushing the USD to lows and buoying the ES to highs. <strong>According to early reports, Europe reportedly made concessions to Trump in trade talks, agreeing to lower industrial tariffs and import more US soybeans. The two leaders will give a joint press conference in aftermarket trade.</strong> Regarding China, Trump on Wednesday tweeted &#39;The US was being nice on China, until now&#39; adding to the US-Sino tensions. In the context of the one-time aid programme for farmers the Trump administration authorised on Tuesday, a Chinese state planner announced that China will provide policy support for workers affected by structural adjustment and trade frictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK Trade Minister Fox said the UK has had constructive meetings in the US on trade and cannot allow the opportunity for a bilateral agreement with the UK, noting the UK wants as much trade access without tying hands. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Mexico&rsquo;s Foreign Affairs Minister Videgaray said negotiations are at a very advanced stage but challenges still remain. Canada&rsquo;s Freeland said the renewed NAFTA deal can be realised. Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo noted the essence of NAFTA is trilateral and will continue to be trilateral and that the three sides need to show flexibility to reach an agreement, going against Trump&rsquo;s proposal of bilateral negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US NEW HOME SALES </strong>plunged by 5.3% in June, more than the expected drop of 2.8%, with house sales in the South suffering the most. Analysts at Wells Fargo suggest that affordability is holding back sales given the higher mortgage rates and the elevated house prices, noting &lsquo;rising rates appear to be causing buyers to shift to less expensive homes or put off buying altogether&rsquo;. As for outlook, Wells Fargo said &lsquo;housing simply is not going to strengthen as much as had been hoped&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures have grinded higher today with the Emini 500 reaching highs of 2834.5 as trade war concerns alleviated following positive comments from US President Trump and EU&rsquo;s Juncker, who are optimistic on a deal between the two blocs. Along with news that Senate was introducing a bipartisan bill to prevent Trump applying auto tariffs under national security rules propelled the ES to the highest since February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EARNINGS: </strong>As the second busiest day of earnings season kicked off, Boeing (BA) beat on top and bottom line, however it forecast its FY core EPS below Wall St. expectations, this resulted in the DJI underperforming the US today as the name accounts for 10% of the index. Auto names were hit after earnings from General Motors (GM), shares fell by the most since 2011 today whose EPS missed expectations and they cut their FY Adj. EPS forecast to $6 from $6.41 due to higher steel and aluminium costs. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) also reported figures where its adjusted EBIT came in lower than expectations, FCAU also cut its revenue guidance. The combination of the two added pressure to its competitors, with the likes of Volkswagen (VOW3 GY) who closed the EU session with losses of 2.7%, Ford (F) were also hit ahead of their earnings tonight at 21:15 BST / 16:15 EST. Coca Cola (KO) led the Dow after its numbers beat on both ends as its diet drinks sales increased, however it did note revenues were hit with a 15% headwind after the refranchising of its company owned bottling operations. AT&amp;T (T) reported AMC on Tuesday and the name hit a 6 year low as its revenue missed estimates and were also lower by 2% on a y/y basis, however it forecasts its 2018 adjusted EPS in the high $3.50 range, above expectations of $3.44.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*M&amp;A: </strong>Today marks the deadline for the deal with Qualcomm (QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) where QCOM is to acquire NXPI for USD 44bln, however QCOM said they would abandon the deal if they cannot win approval from Chinese regulators by 23:59 EST on Wednesday July 25th, and the two are still yet to hear from the anti-trust regulators in China, and QCOM was reported to be considering buybacks in that event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) SETTLES 78 CENTS HIGHER AT $69.30; BRENT (U8) SETTLES 49 CENTS HIGHER AT $73.93.</strong> Weekly inventory data showed a larger-than-expected drawdown for headline crude stocks (6.15mln vs exp 2.33mln), Cushing saw a draw of 1.13mln; the products also drew down, with distillate stocks lower by 100k, and gasoline stocks lower by 2.33mln. Headline crude stocks in the US are now at the lowest seasonal level since 2014, and 67mln barrels above its 10-year average, according to Reuters; US distillate stockpiles are at their lowest in more than a decade. Elsewhere, Russia raised its 2018 oil output forecast to 11.02mln BPD, a new 30-year high. In Libya, the Zawia oil terminal is poised to exit its force majeure shortly and a shipment has been booked for later in the month, according to Argus, and the Amal oil field flow is said to fall to 8K BPD on power cuts. Finally, Iranian events continue to warrant attention: the revolutionary guard on Wednesday said that US threats on oil can be easily answered, while the foreign ministry said Iran says will respond in kind if US tries to block oil exports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 3 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-21</strong>. The US Treasury sold USD 36bln of 5-year notes in a decent sale which saw a stop-through of 1bps, and better participation from indirects. The curve was mixed on Wednesday, with 2-year yields printing fresh near-decade highs ahead of next week&rsquo;s FOMC. US new home sales data garnered little price action, with traders opting to keep their powder dry ahead of the Trump/Juncker meeting. The curve continued to flatten, with 2s30s narrow by around 3bps at settlement, 2s5s flatter by slightly less than that, while other major curve spread were narrower modestly. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Positive comments from Trump and Juncker regarding trade, along with news that senators are looking to tie Trump&rsquo;s hands on auto tariffs helped push the USD lower, amid a constructive risk tone. The DXY remains beneath 94.40 as we head into Asia, with the nearest technical support is seen around 94.207-200 and this area incorporates Monday&rsquo;s session low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>The yen advanced against the buck, falling through 111.00 to lows above 110.67 after Nikkei reported that the BoJ will review its allocation of ETF purchases at its policy meeting next week, in keeping with the recent sources stories which suggest that the central bank may make some tweaks to its policy settings after the disappointing run of inflation of late. However, some (Goldman Sachs, for instance) do not believe changes will be forthcoming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie has emerged as top G10 performer and is retesting highs vs its US rival not seen since the BoC hiked rates and delivered an upbeat assessment that warrants further tightening depending on incoming data. USDCAD filled bids through 1.3140-30 and 1.3115-00 to trade sub 1.3090, and USDCAD saw further downside in the afternoon post-Trump/Juncker initial comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CHF: </strong>All around 0.2-0.25% ahead vs the Greenback, with the Kiwi maintaining 0.6800+ status after a NZ trade data-related wobble overnight (surprise deficit), but perhaps hampered by the proximity of a mega (1.75 bn) option expiry at the strike running off on Thursday. The single currency is attempting to climb over 1.1700 again and has at least one eye on the ECB meeting tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Cable remains choppy above 1.3150 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and with the 20 DMA at 1.3175 capping further recovery gains towards 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Relatively deflated all day in wake of sub-consensus headline CPI data for Q2, but managing to stay above 0.7400 vs the USD and still trading in lock-step with Yuan (or at least swings in US-China trade sentiment). Note, the CNY and CNH both unwound more losses vs the Dollar to circa 6.7500-7600 vs the latest 6.8000 PBoC mid-point fix and recent lows approaching 6.8500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Another decent day all round, but especially for the Lira amidst reports that the US Pastor imprisoned due to terrorist link accusations has been moved from jail to house arrest, while the Peso got a welcome boost from significantly stronger than forecast Mexican retail sales, alongside improving NAFTA deal prospects. USDTRY down to 4.8200 and USDMXN 18.7000 approximately at best.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some minor range breaks and net Dollar weakness ahead of the US-EU summit to discuss trade relations (Trump vs Juncker showdown kicks off at 18.30BST, and latter is due to address the press at 21.00BST), with the DXY down below 94.400 at one stage having topped out above 94.500 yet again. To recap, nearest technical support is seen around 94.207-200 and this area incorporates Monday&rsquo;s session low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie has emerged as top G10 performer and is retesting highs vs its US rival not seen since the BoC hiked rates and delivered an upbeat assessment that warrants further tightening depending on incoming data. Usd/Cad filled bids through 1.3140-30 and 1.3115-00 to trade under 1.3090 vs the aforementioned post-July 11 policy meeting low circa 1.3060.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/EUR/GBP/JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All around 0.2-0.25% ahead vs the Greenback, with the Kiwi maintaining 0.6800+ status after a NZ trade data-related wobble overnight (surprise deficit), but perhaps hampered by the proximity of a mega (1.75 bn) option expiry at the strike running off on Thursday. The single currency is attempting to climb over 1.1700 again, but half-heartedly awaiting any developments/agreement from the White House summit and with at least one eye on the ECB meeting tomorrow. Cable remains choppy around 1.3150 amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty and with the 20 DMA at 1.3175 capping further recovery gains towards 1.3200, while Usd/Jpy is finding 111.00 a tough level to break on the downside, but appears on track to close below its 20 DMA (111.44-50) and a key Fib (111.25), which would be bearish from a chart perspective. The Franc is still in a Summer stupor and hemmed into a 0.9945-05 range, while pivoting 1.1600 vs the Eur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relatively deflated all day in wake of sub-consensus headline CPI data for Q2, but managing to stay above 0.7400 vs the Usd and still trading in lock-step with Yuan (or at least swings in US-China trade sentiment). Note, the Cny and Cnh both unwound more losses vs the Dollar to circa 6.7500-7600 vs the latest 6.8000 PBoC mid-point fix and recent lows approaching 6.8500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another decent day all round, but especially for the Lira amidst reports that the US Pastor imprisoned due to terrorist link accusations has been moved from jail to house arrest, while the Peso got a welcome boost from significantly stronger than forecast Mexican retail sales, alongside improving NAFTA deal prospects. Usd/Try down to 4.8200 and Usd/Mxn 18.7000 approximately at best.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.3%) was negative amid broad weakness across the index aside from the commodity-related sectors, while materials names and continued strength in Japanese banks kept the Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) afloat. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.1%) were varied as Hong Kong was led higher by oil names including Sinopec which expects its highest H1 profit since 2013 and with the mainland less decisive following a liquidity drain by the PBoC, while the KOSPI (-0.3%) was dampened on earnings including LG Display.

The Healthcare sector was lifted by GSK&rsquo;s (+1.5%) earnings, while tech names underperform amid weak earnings from STMicroelectronics (-4.1%) who currently rest at the foot of the CAC 40. France&rsquo;s LVMH (+1.7%) rose to the top of the index post-earnings, dragging up the likes of Kering (+2.6%). Ageas (4.2%) shares are lifted by reports Hong Kong&rsquo;s Fosun is weighing a USD 10bln takeover of the company. A few US heavyweights are expected to report earnings today; Boeing (12.30 BST), UPS (12:45BST), Facebook, Visa and PayPal (21:05BST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Minimal movement in Dollar pairings, as the index continues to pivot around the 94.500 axis looking for more direction that might emanate from US-EU trade talks later rather than data in the form of new home sales. However, some signs of a shift in sentiment overnight and potential change in the recent trend of further Yuan depreciation post-PBoC Usd/Cny fixing, as both the on-shore and off-shore units hold above 6.8000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The marginal G10 underperformer amidst another loss of momentum above 0.7400 vs its US counterpart and 1.0900 against the NZD on slightly softer than forecast Aussie Q2 inflation, albeit with headline y/y CPI back into the RBA&rsquo;s 2-3% target range for the first time in almost 3 years. Conversely, the Kiwi has recovered from a sub-0.6800 dip following an unexpected June trade deficit, albeit only just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP/EUR - All mildly firmer vs the Usd, but rangebound, with the Loonie sitting near the base of a 1.3165-25 band, Franc at the low end of 0.9945-10&nbsp;parameters and Cable holding around&nbsp;1.3150 after an uptick in UK mortgage apps, and ahead of CBI trades. Meanwhile, not a lot of reaction to slightly better than anticipated German Ifo survey readings or Eurozone money supply from the single currency that is probing 1.1700 again, and remains capped ahead of 0.8900 vs the Pound, with more focus on tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting and any further policy guidance (even though unlikely given QE and rate signals delivered only last month).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Usd/Jpy meandering between 111.05-40 and still delicately poised around a 111.25 Fib, while latest reports on the end of month BoJ meeting suggest no change in policy likely until October, and in stark contract to sources perhaps even more easing rather than any hawkish tweak (per so called &lsquo;experts&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Aside from the aforementioned Cny and Cnh counter-moves, other EMs, including the Try, have recouped more losses vs the Greenback, with the Mxn aided by latest positive NAFTA noises to rebound further from 20.000 and through 19.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tepid Bobl launch based on all the usual metrics used to gauge the strength of an auction has undermined German bond futures, with the 5 year contract retesting lows just below parity and the 10 year Bund paring gains to single digits vs almost 20 ticks at best. Meanwhile, Gilts have slipped back into negative territory in wake of another better than expected UK CBI survey, and this time distributive trades to a marginal new LIFFE low of 123.20 (-11 ticks). Elsewhere, US Treasuries are back down from overnight peaks ahead of more supply ($36 bn 5 year notes and $18 bn 2 year FRNs) and some secondary data, but perhaps more importantly the Trump-Juncker tariff summit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.2%) trades marginally softer with Brent (+0.9%) higher after breaching USD 74.00/bbl to the upside. Last night&rsquo;s API Crude inventories printed a larger than expected drawdown (-3.160M vs. Exp. -2.300M), tempering oversupply concerns that have weighed on markets recently. Of note, an IMF report commented on the steep inflation rise in Venezuela (while sanction risks remain), which has subsequently limited its ability to boost oil output. (Of note: Venezuelan oil production fell to a new 30-year low of 1.5mln BPD in June). Traders will be watching today&rsquo;s DoE Crude inventories which are expected to show a draw of 2.331M barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.5%) gradually crawls higher as USD strength eases. Copper is flat while traders are eyeing the latest developments at the world&rsquo;s largest copper mine, BHP&rsquo;s Escondida in Chile. The Anglo-Australian miner had made its final offer with the union regarding an increase in wages, markets await further updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (20 Jul) -3.160M vs. Exp. -2.300M (Prev. +0.629M). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Libya&rsquo;s Zawia oil terminal is poised to exit its force majeure shortly and a shipment has been booked for later in the month. (Argus News)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/19698/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are relatively mixed (Eurostoxx 50 -0.2%) as focus remain on earning season. Tech names underperform amid weak earnings from STMicroelectronics (-3.5%) who currently rest at the foot of the CAC 40. France&rsquo;s LMVH (+2.3%) rose to the top of the index post-earnings, dragging up the likes of Kering (+2.6%). Sweden&rsquo;s S.E.B (+10%) shares received a boost from a guidance upgrade, while Ageas (5.0%) shares are lifted by reports Hong Kong&rsquo;s Fosun is weighing a USD 10bln takeover of the company. A few US heavyweights are expected to report earnings today; Boeing (12.30 BST), UPS (12:45BST), Facebook, Visa and PayPal (21:05BST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - Minimal movement in Dollar pairings, as the index continues to pivot around the 94.500 axis looking for more direction that might emanate from US-EU trade talks later rather than data in the form of new home sales. However, some signs of a shift in sentiment overnight and potential change in the recent trend of further Yuan depreciation post-PBoC Usd/Cny fixing, as both the on-shore and off-shore units hold above 6.8000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD - The marginal G10 underperformer amidst another loss of momentum above 0.7400 vs its US counterpart and 1.0900 against the NZD on slightly softer than forecast Aussie Q2 inflation, albeit with headline y/y CPI back into the RBA&rsquo;s 2-3% target range for the first time in almost 3 years. Conversely, the Kiwi has recovered from a sub-0.6800 dip following an unexpected June trade deficit, albeit only just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/GBP/EUR - All mildly firmer vs the Usd, but rangebound, with the Loonie sitting near the base of a 1.3165-35 band, Franc at the low end of 0.9945-25 parameters and Cable holding above 1.3150 after an uptick in UK mortgage apps, and ahead of CBI trades. Meanwhile, not a lot of reaction to slightly better than anticipated German Ifo survey readings or Eurozone money supply from the single currency that is nestling just under 1.1700, and 0.8900 vs the Pound, with more focus on tomorrow&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting and any further policy guidance (even though unlikely given QE and rate signals delivered only last month).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY - Usd/Jpy meandering between 111.15-40 and still delicately poised around a 111.25 Fib, while latest reports on the end of month BoJ meeting suggest no change in policy likely until October, and in stark contract to sources perhaps even more easing rather than any hawkish tweak (per so called &lsquo;experts&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Aside from the aforementioned Cny and Cnh counter-moves, other EMs, including the Try, have recouped more losses vs the Greenback, with the Mxn aided by latest positive NAFTA noises to rebound further from 20.000 and through 19.000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notwithstanding slightly firmer external leads, Gilts wobbled off the Liffe open and dipped a bit further after an initial 123.26 print to 123.23 before regrouping and tracking a further uptick in Bunds/USTs to trade up at 123.39 vs yesterday&rsquo;s 123.31 settlement price. Note, the core Eurozone bond has now tested and marginally breached the upper end of fib resistance at 162.44 to 162.47 (+19 ticks vs -3 ticks at a new Eurex low around the EU cash equity opens), but not followed through to expose the next upside objective between 162.54-57 yet. Attention now turns the new German Bobl launch after slightly more upbeat Ifo survey indicators and stronger than expected EZ M3 data. Back to Liffe, the Short Sterling strip continues to marginally underperform a tick below par here and there, obviously acknowledging the 80%+ probability assigned to an August BoE rate hike. Ahead, CBI distributive trades the sole UK release scheduled today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI trades flat, straddling just above USD 68.50/bbl, whilst Brent eyes USD 74.00/bbl to the upside. Last night&rsquo;s API Crude inventories printed a larger than expected drawdown (-3.160M vs. Exp. -2.300M), tempering oversupply concerns that have weighed on markets recently. Of note, an IMF report commented on the steep inflation rise in Venezuela (while sanction risks remain), which has subsequently limited its ability to boost oil output. (Of note: Venezuelan oil production fell to a new 30-year low of 1.5mln BPD in June). Traders will be watching today&rsquo;s DoE Crude inventories which are expected to show a draw of 2.331M barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold (+0.3%) gradually crawls higher as USD strength eases. Copper is flat while traders are eyeing the latest developments at the world&rsquo;s largest copper mine, BHP&rsquo;s Escondida in Chile. The Anglo-Australian miner had made its final offer with the union regarding an increase in wages, markets await further updates.</p>\r\n",
