(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The market opened higher today assisted by progressive China-US trade developments, in particular tech (NFLX, CRM, AMZN, FB, ORCL) and semiconductors (AVGO, AMD, MU). Industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) also traded higher on trade developments. The energy sector was uplifted by the rise in crude oil prices which stayed in the green for most of the session. United Rentals (URI) outperformed following the announcement of a resumed share repurchase programme and strong 2019 outlook. Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) surged on its US IPO today. Following a raise in yields today, financial stocks BlackRock (BLK) and JPMorgan (JPM); in turn, the real estate sector (SPG, AMT, PSA, VTR) underperformed. Verizon (VZ) opened lower on the back of a downgrade at Morgan Stanley, weighing down the telecoms sector. More broadly, the defensive utilities and consumer discretionary sectors underperformed out of the pack as risk appetite improved today. SPX +0.54% at 2651, NDX +0.89% at 6763, DJI +0.64% at 24527.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Positive risk sentiment pressured the complex on Wednesday which remained in negative territory; in early US trade, selling action extended after WSJ reports suggested that China are looking to boost access to oversee countries. The complex pared back some losses after the 10-year auction which was soft overall. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end and belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed but mostly steeper heading into the close. The US treasury sold USD 24bln of 10-year tailing by 0.5bps at a high yield 2.915%. Demand for the auction was below recent averages as indicated by the bid-to-cover which was the lowest since February. Indirects were awarded the smallest share since August, directs took the largest portion since September and dealers were left with a share close to recent averages. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 5+ tick lower at 120-09.</p>\r\n",

The vote represented a comfortable victory, given that 199 voted for her to be leader of the Conservative Party. According to reports earlier in the session, May pledged to Conservative lawmakers that should would not lead the party into the next General Election in 2022, implying that she wants to get the Brexit deal through, and then hand the reins over to someone else. Following the results, sterling dropped from 1.2640 to below 1.2600 with traders seemingly concerned about margins of MPs voting against her leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>The WSJ reported that China are preparing to increase access for overseas companies, adding that Beijing is working to replace its &ldquo;Made in China 2025&rdquo; plan with one that plays down its bid to dominate manufacturing. White House Chief Economist Kevin Hassett said that China trade talks have made positive progress while US Commerce Secretary Ross stated that European car names, citing BMW, will benefit from China lowering US auto import tariffs; he also noted that the US travel advisory news was just a rumour and that Trump has not made a decision yet on the Huawei CFO. Separately, European Parliament lawmakers have approved the beginning of a free trade deal between the EU and Japan. Elsewhere, the US has rejected the EU trade reform proposal, placing the WTO at risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>A source cited by Interfax announced that the EU will react to Russia&#39;s actions in Azov Sea with 6-month sanctions extensions. This followed comments from a German government official who stated there was no consensus within the EU over imposing fresh sanctions on the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>Following his meeting with EU Commission President Juncker, Italy&rsquo;s PM Conte announced that the 2019 deficit goal is now 2.04%/GDP and stressed that the proposals to tweak next year&#39;s budget don&#39;t betray promises to Italians; he reassured that citizens income will be part of the manoeuvre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US CPI</strong> was flat in November pushing the yy figure lower to 2.2% from 2.5% mostly reflecting the recent plunge in oil prices. Apparel, transport fares and personal computers were also softer. The core inflation measure rose 0.2% supported by housing, medical care and recreation. Looking ahead, ING analysts expect core measures to climb through the first half of 2019 also noting that PPI is moving higher as &ldquo;pipeline pressures are building more broadly in an economy which has rapidly been eating into its spare capacity&rdquo;. They likewise note that the latest inflation data should continue to support the Fed&rsquo;s hiking trajectory with the next rate hike now almost fully priced at next Thursday&rsquo;s meeting; looking at the longer-term ING forecasts &ldquo;three further 25bp rate hikes next year&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) SETTLES USD 0.50 LOWER AT USD 51.15/BBL, BRENT (F9) SETTLES USD 0.05 LOWER AT USD 60.15/BBL. &nbsp;</strong>Oil prices held on to their recent gains for most of the session underpinned by risk-on market sentiment as well as today&rsquo;s DoE crude inventories coinciding with a large crude draw in APIs; distillates also showed a larger than expected draw and gasoline a smaller than anticipated build. Nonetheless, gains were pared back sharply in pre-settlement trade as equities came off their highs, pushing WTI in negative territory. The latest OPEC monthly report saw crude production falling 11k BPD in November to average 32.97mln BPD while also forecasting global oil demand increasing by 1.5mln BPD and 1.29mln BPD in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Production is seen growing by 2.5mln BPD and 2.16bln BPD in 2018 and 2019, respectively; Citi argues that the figures &ldquo;still reflect the state of the market prior to the OPEC+ production cuts which will trim both the non-OPEC supply numbers and OPEC&rsquo;s own output from January&rdquo; and markets are yet to determine whether that will be enough &ldquo;to keep a floor under prices&rdquo;. In news flow, the WSJ reported that Saudi and Kuwait are nearing a restart of the joint oil-field pact in Q1 2019 as the US has brokered a deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;SPX +0.54% at 2651, NDX +0.89% at 6763, DJI +0.64% at 24527. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.33%, Materials +0.95%, Industrials +0.54%, Cons Discretionary +1.05%, Cons Staples -0.16%, Healthcare +0.86%, Financials +0.44%, Tech +0.79%, Telecoms +0.82%, Utilities -0.58%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> The market opened higher today assisted by progressive China-US trade developments, in particular tech (NFLX, CRM, AMZN, FB, ORCL) and semiconductors (AVGO, AMD, MU). Industrial heavyweights Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT) also traded higher on trade developments. The energy sector was uplifted by the rise in crude oil prices which stayed in the green for most of the session. United Rentals (URI) outperformed following the announcement of a resumed share repurchase programme and strong 2019 outlook. Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) surged on its US IPO today. Following a raise in yields today, financial stocks BlackRock (BLK) and JPMorgan (JPM); in turn, the real estate sector (SPG, AMT, PSA, VTR) underperformed. Verizon (VZ) opened lower on the back of a downgrade at Morgan Stanley, weighing down the telecoms sector. More broadly, the defensive utilities and consumer discretionary sectors underperformed out of the pack as risk appetite improved today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE &nbsp;5+ TICK LOWER AT 120-09. </strong>Positive risk sentiment pressured the complex on Wednesday which remained in negative territory; in early US trade, selling action extended after WSJ reports suggested that China are looking to boost access to oversee countries. The complex pared back some losses after the 10-year auction which was soft overall. Most of the action was concentrated in the front end and belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps at settlement. Spreads were mixed but mostly steeper heading into the close. The US treasury sold USD 24bln of 10-year tailing by 0.5bps at a high yield 2.915%. Demand for the auction was below recent averages as indicated by the bid-to-cover which was the lowest since February. Indirects were awarded the smallest share since August, directs took the largest portion since September and dealers were left with a share close to recent averages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* 30-YEAR BONDS PREVIEW: T</strong>he US Treasury will auction USD 38bln of 3-year notes (Tues), USD 24bln of 10-year notes (Wed) and USD 16bln of 30-year bonds (Thu). Societe Generale says the 30-year auction lacks set up: &ldquo;The sector seems rich on the Treasury spline versus the old 30s, with the outright yield trading below the past two auction stops and rich by almost 30bp compared with the November stop,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;the sector is not particularly cheap on the curve, the 5s30s curve flattening by more than 6bp since last Friday.&rdquo; SocGen also notes that the November cycle saw demand drop with funds reducing their takedown, which weighed on the performance of the auction; additionally, the proximity to next week&rsquo;s FOMC meeting (where the central bank is expected to lift rates by 25bps) could act as a negative. However, on the other side of the coin, SocGen sys that any cover demand from the large short positioning in the sector may help support demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>As noted, Eur/Usd has bounced firmly from worst levels near 1.1300 and key support just above the big figure, with a hefty 2.4 bn option expiry also propping prices up along with reports about more convergence between Italy and the EU on 2019 budget lines, and a generally soft Greenback. The headline pair is back over 1.1350 as a result, while the DXY has pulled back further from best levels (97.500) breaking below 97.000 in wake of broadly as expected US CPI data and soft real earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, AUD, NZD: </strong>More divergence for the non-US Dollars as the Loonie derived momentum from firm oil prices and&nbsp; the latest rise in overall risk sentiment to extend recovery gains around 1.3350, while the Aud appears to be establishing a solid base above 0.7200 as the primary currency proxy for changing US-China trade dynamics (aside from the Yuan of course &ndash; Usd/Cnh down from recent 6.9000+ highs and below the overnight Usd/Cny PBoC midpoint fix). Conversely, the Kiwi was unable to keep its head above 0.6850 as the Aud/Nzd cross around 1.0550, despite praise from RBNZ&rsquo;s Orr for its outstanding behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>The renowned, if not always conforming safe-havens remained relatively rangebound given the ongoing revival in risk appetite on latest reports that China is looking to revise intentions set out in the 2025 plan and relax rules of access for foreign companies, plus growing support for the UK Conservative Party head and speculation that Rome may be getting close to the 2% deficit mark. Usd/Jpy was capped by heavy domestic supply at 113.50 and drifted back towards 113.25, while the Franc pushed just above 0.9900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>The Rand stood out amidst widespread gains vs the Buck, with more headway made on a chart basis and following SA inflation data that beat consensus &ndash; Usd/Zar testing 14.1000 from 14.3500+ at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: ECB Monetary Policy Decision</strong> Due At 12:45 GMT, 13:45 CET, 07:45 EST, On Thursday 13th December 2018, Press Conference Due At 13:30 GMT, 14:30 CET 08:30 EST. Unanimous expectations look for the ECB to leave its three key rates unchanged. Will the bank continue to view risks to the Eurozone economy as broadly balanced? Focus for the press conference will centre around staff economic projections, reinvestment policy and TLTROs. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20756/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: Norges Bank Monetary Policy Decision</strong> Due at 09:00 GMT, 10:00 CET, 04:00EST, On Thursday 13thDecember 2018, Press Conference Due At 09:30GMT, 10:30 CET, 04:30 EST. Expectations unanimously set on an unchanged rate on 0.75%. SEB expect the Norges Bank to lift the short-term inflation trajectory. Danske Bank expect a flatter rate path for 2020-21. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20757/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PREVIEW: SNB Interest Rate Decision</strong> Due At 08:30GMT,03:30 EST On Thursday 13th December 2018, Press Conference At 09:00GMT, 04:00 EST. SNB widely expected to keep the 3-month Libor at -0.75% with the corridor to be held at -1.25% to -0.25%. Board members are expected to reiterate the &ldquo;highly valued&rdquo; CHF and preparedness for FX intervention. Focus will be on the SNB&rsquo;s updated inflation forecasts given the softer November CPI and firmer CHF. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20758/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

With 10-year yields beneath the November auction stop-out rate (and all the stop-out rates going to July), analysts at SocGen say Wednesday&rsquo;s auction will likely be &ldquo;under pressure&rdquo;. &ldquo;On relative value metrics, the current note is trading rich on the Treasury spline versus old 10s compared with the previous two cycles, while it has slightly cheapened over the past two sessions on the curve versus 5s and 30s, though it is still rich compared with the previous auction levels,&rdquo; the bank writes. It also suggests that the recent flattening of the 2s10s curve could be a negative, as well as the recent increase in dealer holdings. It is also worth noting that ahead of the auction, the November CPI data will be released, which could influence the tone of the auction. On the flip side, SocGen notes that current 10s are trading special in repo, which indicates a short base, which could offset headwinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recent history&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>High-yield: (Prev. 3.21%, six-auction average: 3.03%)</li>\r\n  <li>Tail: (Prev. stop-through 1.20bps, six-auction average: stop-through 0.3bps)</li>\r\n  <li>Bid-to-Cover: (Prev. 2.54x, six-auction average: 2.54x)</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers: (Prev. 25%, six-auction average: 26.3%)</li>\r\n  <li>Direct: (Prev. 1%, six-auction average: 9.3%)</li>\r\n  <li>Indirect: (Prev. 74%, six-auction average: 64%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It remains to be seen if the latest marked recovery from deeper ytd lows in Cable and 0.9050+ vs the Eur is premature, but the Pound has made another round trip and extended its outperformance vs G10 counterparts on prospects that UK PM May will fend off the looming challenge to her leadership, and perhaps emerge from the vote of no confidence in a more secure position. Indeed, Cable is now around 1.2645 from circa 1.2478 and the cross is back near 0.9025 even though the single currency has performed pretty well in its own right against the Dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, Eur/Usd has bounced firmly from worst levels near 1.1300 and key support just above the big figure, with a hefty 2.4 bn option expiry also propping prices up along with reports about more convergence between Italy and the EU on 2019 budget lines, and a generally soft Greenback. The headline pair is back over 1.1350 as a result, while the DXY has pulled back further from best levels (97.500) towards 97.000 in wake of broadly as expected US CPI data and soft real earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More divergence for the non-US Dollars as the Loonie derived momentum from firm oil prices and &nbsp;the latest rise in overall risk sentiment to extend recovery gains beyond 1.3350, while the Aud appears to be establishing a solid base above 0.7200 as the primary currency proxy for changing US-China trade dynamics (aside from the Yuan of course &ndash; Usd/Cnh down from recent 6.9000+ highs and below the overnight Usd/Cny PBoC midpoint fix). Conversely, the Kiwi was unable to keep its head above 0.6850 as the Aud/Nzd cross reclaimed 1.0550, albeit just, and despite praise from RBNZ&rsquo;s Orr for its outstanding behaviour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renowned, if not always conforming safe-havens remained relatively rangebound given the ongoing revival in risk appetite on latest reports that China is looking to revise intentions set out in the 2025 plan and relax rules of access for foreign companies, plus growing support for the UK Conservative Party head and speculation that Rome may be getting close to the 2% deficit mark. Usd/Jpy was capped by heavy domestic supply at 113.50 and drifted back towards 113.25, while the Franc hovered just below 0.9900.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rand stood out amidst widespread gains vs the Buck, with more headway made on a chart basis and following SA inflation data that beat consensus &ndash; Usd/Zar testing 14.1000 from 14.3500+ at one stage.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.2%) gained from the open with energy and tech the front-runners in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed as it benefitted from USD/JPY&rsquo;s slipstream and with the BoJ said to have purchased a record JPY 6tln of ETFs so far this year. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) were positive on hopes of a potential tariff cut on US autos and encouraging comments from US President Trump, while news that Huawei&rsquo;s CFO was released on bail and the recent better than expected lending data from China also added to the optimism.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are higher across the board (Euro Stoxx 50 +1.3%) following the strong performance experienced in Asia overnight after sentiment was underpinned as news flow spurred optimism regarding a US-China trade deal. France&rsquo;s CAC 40 (+1.6%) outperforms its peers on the back of shares in Kering (+2.0%) amid an upgrade at Deutsche Bank and Pernod Ricard (+3.6%) after upbeat comments from activist investor Elliott on the Co. Meanwhile, Spain&rsquo;s IBEX 35 (+0.80%) marginally lags peers as the index is weighed on by shares in heavyweight Inditex (-4.0%) following disappointing earnings. Moving on, sectors are experiencing broad-based gains with marginal outperformance in utility names. In terms of notable movers, auto names are performing particularly well (Stoxx 600 Auto &amp; Parts +1.5%) in a continuation of the positive momentum from potential Chinese tariffs cuts on US autos from 40% to 15%. Meanwhile, Dixons Carphone (-8.2%) shares fell in excess of 10% at one point after the company downgraded interim dividend guidance alongside expectations for higher net debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just the most volatile major, but displaying considerable resilience (or complacency?) in the face of perhaps the biggest Brexit hurdle in the form of a challenge to UK PM May&rsquo;s leadership, not to mention all the political uncertainty if she fails to survive. However, Cable has recovered well from new ytd lows circa 1.2478 and almost reached 1.2550 before waning again as a number of high profile Cabinet members voiced public support for the current Conservative head in the run up to tonight&rsquo;s confidence vote. A hefty 1 bn option expiry at the 1.2500 strike may be exerting a gravitational pull, while Eur/Gbp is pivoting 0.9950, as the single currency continues to weather its own storm via Italian and French budget excesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to Sterling&rsquo;s stellar performance, the Kiwi and Swedish Krona have slipped to the bottom of the G10 ranks, as Nzd/Usd reverses from 0.6900 to within a few pips of 0.6850, regardless of RBNZ Orr&rsquo;s assertion that the currency has been &lsquo;remarkably&rsquo; obedient, and Eur/Sek rebounds sharply from sub-10.3000 to just over 10.3700 at one stage in wake of softer than forecast Swedish inflation data. Note, the Riksbank&rsquo;s preferred CPIF measure was especially benign and well below the Bank&rsquo;s own estimate, undermining December hike expectations to around evens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/AUD/CAD/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs a generally firmer Greenback (DXY just off a fresh 97.500 recent peak) and the ongoing revival in broad risk sentiment amidst heightened hopes of a tangible improvement in US-China trade relations. Eur/Usd has survived another, deeper test of 1.1300 support where a massive 2.4 bn expiries reside and are perhaps helping to keep the headline pair cushioned against Italian/French deficit issues ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting. Meanwhile, the Aud and Loonie are feeding off the aforementioned improved risk appetite, with the former holding above 0.7200 and latter rebounding a bit further from 1.3400+ lows with the added incentive of rebounding crude prices. The Franc is meandering in a tight range between 0.9950-20 and encircling 1.1250 vs the Eur awaiting the final 2018 SNB Quarterly review tomorrow, while Usd/Jpy is equally restrained within 113.50-30 trading parameters with the topside said to be laden with Japanese offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the Sek, firmer than expected SA CPI has underpinned the Zar around 14.3100 vs the Dollar, but the Rand may also be drawing momentum from option-related flows alongside bullish technical impulses as 1 bn expiries roll off at the 14.5000 strike today</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts are still off worst levels but have printed a new low to trade around the 124.00 handle as more MP&rsquo;s come out in support of the PM, including key ministers such as Gove, Mourdant and Williamson and the running total of those in support >70 ahead of the no confidence vote results at 9pm.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Bunds have seen similar price action with the German 10-year settling just below 163.40 after failing to test Monday&rsquo;s 162.59 high, with German participants keeping a close eye on no-confidence developments and Italian and French counterparts. On that note, BTPs extend their outperformance vs. their EU counterparts (fresh high at 124.37) amidst suggestions the EU will take a softer approach given France&rsquo;s budget position alongside now refuted suggestions of an early election and PM Conte set to present revised budget numbers to Juncker.&nbsp; OATs are recovering some composure and almost touched 151.00 after yesterday&rsquo;s heavy losses and underperformance with the French 10-year trading with gains of over 10 ticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US Treasuries see little action ahead of issuance later in the day in the form of a 10 year auction with US 2s/10s building a solid base above 10bps, with the US also releasing CPI figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (7 Dec) -10.18mln vs. Exp. -3.0mln (Prev. +5.36mln). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (+1.8%) and Brent (+1.7%) trade with firm gains amid the improvement in the risk sentiment as US-Sino trade discussion seem to be on track, with US President Trump expressing optimism via Twitter yesterday. Furthermore, prices may be underpinned in light of last night&rsquo;s API crude inventories which showed a much wider-than-expected draw of 10.18mln barrels vs. the expected draw of 3.0mln barrels. Traders will be eyeing this afternoon&rsquo;s weekly DoE inventory release for a fresh catalyst (alongside production numbers) in which crude inventories are expected to decrease by 3.0mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of metals, spot gold (+0.1%) remains steady as the dollar index remains within a tight range while copper traded sideways near weekly highs in light of the improvement in risk sentiment. Elsewhere, Shanghai steel snapped a three-day losing streak amid talks of production cuts at the top steelmaking city, Tangshan.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/20754/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are higher across the board (Euro Stoxx 50 +1.1%) following the strong performance experienced in Asia overnight after sentiment was underpinned as news flow spurred optimism regarding a US-China trade deal. France&rsquo;s CAC 40 (+1.6%) outperforms its peers on the back of shares in Kering (+2.7%) amid an upgrade at Deutsche Bank and Pernod Ricard (+3.6%) after upbeat comments from activist investor Elliott on the Co. Meanwhile, Spain&rsquo;s IBEX 35 (+0.80%) marginally lags peers as the index is weighed on by shares in heavyweight Inditex (-5.0%) following disappointing earnings. Moving on, sectors are experiencing broad-based gains with marginal outperformance in utility names. In terms of notable movers, auto names are performing particularly well (Stoxx 600 Auto &amp; Parts +1.5%) in a continuation of the positive momentum from potential Chinese tariffs cuts on US autos from 40% to 15%. Meanwhile, Dixons Carphone (-8.6%) shares fell in excess of 10% at one point after the company downgraded interim dividend guidance alongside expectations for higher net debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just the most volatile major, but displaying considerable resilience (or complacency?) in the face of perhaps the biggest Brexit hurdle in the form of a challenge to UK PM May&rsquo;s leadership, not to mention all the political uncertainty if she fails to survive. However, Cable has recovered well from new ytd lows circa 1.2478 and almost reached 1.2550 before waning again as a number of high profile Cabinet members voiced public support for the current Conservative head in the run up to tonight&rsquo;s confidence vote. A hefty 1 bn option expiry at the 1.2500 strike may be exerting a gravitational pull, while Eur/Gbp is pivoting 0.9950, as the single currency continues to weather its own storm via Italian and French budget excesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to Sterling&rsquo;s stellar performance, the Kiwi and Swedish Krona have slipped to the bottom of the G10 ranks, as Nzd/Usd reverses from 0.6900 to within a few pips of 0.6850, regardless of RBNZ Orr&rsquo;s assertion that the currency has been &lsquo;remarkably&rsquo; obedient, and Eur/Sek rebounds sharply from sub-10.3000 to just over 10.3700 at one stage in wake of softer than forecast Swedish inflation data. Note, the Riksbank&rsquo;s preferred CPIF measure was especially benign and well below the Bank&rsquo;s own estimate, undermining December hike expectations to around evens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/AUD/CAD/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs a generally firmer Greenback (DXY just off a fresh 97.500 recent peak) and the ongoing revival in broad risk sentiment amidst heightened hopes of a tangible improvement in US-China trade relations. Eur/Usd has survived another, deeper test of 1.1300 support where a massive 2.4 bn expiries reside and are perhaps helping to keep the headline pair cushioned against Italian/French deficit issues ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting. Meanwhile, the Aud and Loonie are feeding off the aforementioned improved risk appetite, with the former holding above 0.7200 and latter rebounding a bit further from 1.3400+ lows with the added incentive of rebounding crude prices. The Franc is meandering in a tight range between 0.9950-20 and encircling 1.1250 vs the Eur awaiting the final 2018 SNB Quarterly review tomorrow, while Usd/Jpy is equally restrained within 113.50-30 trading parameters with the topside said to be laden with Japanese offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the Sek, firmer than expected SA CPI has underpinned the Zar around 14.3100 vs the Dollar, but the Rand may also be drawing momentum from option-related flows alongside bullish technical impulses as 1 bn expiries roll off at the 14.5000 strike today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts are still off worst levels but have printed a new low to trade around the 124.00 handle as more MP&rsquo;s come out in support of the PM, including key ministers such as Gove, Mourdant and Williamson and the running total of those in support >70 ahead of the no confidence vote results at 9pm.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Bunds have seen similar price action with the German 10-year settling just below 163.40 after failing to test Monday&rsquo;s 162.59 high, with German participants keeping a close eye on no-confidence developments and Italian and French counterparts. On that note, BTPs extend their outperformance vs. their EU counterparts (fresh high at 124.37) amidst suggestions the EU will take a softer approach given France&rsquo;s budget position alongside now refuted suggestions of an early election and PM Conte set to present revised budget numbers to Juncker.&nbsp; OATs are recovering some composure and almost touched 151.00 after yesterday&rsquo;s heavy losses and underperformance with the French 10-year trading with gains of over 10 ticks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, US Treasuries see little action ahead of issuance later in the day in the form of a 10 year auction with US 2s/10s building a solid base above 10bps, with the US also releasing CPI figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;WTI (+1.8%) and Brent (+1.5%) trade with firm gains amid the improvement in the risk sentiment as US-Sino trade discussion seem to be on track, with US President Trump expressing optimism via Twitter yesterday. Furthermore, prices may be underpinned in light of last night&rsquo;s API crude inventories which showed a much wider-than-expected draw of 10.18mln barrels vs. the expected draw of 3.0mln barrels. Traders will be eyeing this afternoon&rsquo;s weekly DoE inventory release for a fresh catalyst (alongside production numbers) in which crude inventories are expected to decrease by 3.0mln barrels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of metals, spot gold (+0.1%) remains steady as the dollar index remains within a tight range while copper traded sideways near weekly highs in light of the improvement in risk sentiment. Elsewhere, Shanghai steel snapped a three-day losing streak amid talks of production cuts at the top steelmaking city, Tangshan.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "FX Morning Colour: Pound pulls back from precipice, but can UK PM May?",
        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not just the most volatile major, but displaying considerable resilience (or complacency?) in the face of perhaps the biggest Brexit hurdle in the form of a challenge to UK PM May&rsquo;s leadership, not to mention all the political uncertainty if she fails to survive. However, Cable has recovered well from new ytd lows circa 1.2478 and almost reached 1.2550 before waning again as a number of high profile Cabinet members voiced public support for the current Conservative head in the run up to tonight&rsquo;s confidence vote. A hefty 1 bn option expiry at the 1.2500 strike may be exerting a gravitational pull, while Eur/Gbp is pivoting 0.9950, as the single currency continues to weather its own storm via Italian and French budget excesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to Sterling&rsquo;s stellar performance, the Kiwi and Swedish Krona have slipped to the bottom of the G10 ranks, as Nzd/Usd reverses from 0.6900 to within a few pips of 0.6850, regardless of RBNZ Orr&rsquo;s assertion that the currency has been &lsquo;remarkably&rsquo; obedient, and Eur/Sek rebounds sharply from sub-10.3000 to just over 10.3700 at one stage in wake of softer than forecast Swedish inflation data. Note, the Riksbank&rsquo;s preferred CPIF measure was especially benign and well below the Bank&rsquo;s own estimate, undermining December hike expectations to around evens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/AUD/CAD/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs a generally firmer Greenback (DXY just off a fresh 97.500 recent peak) and the ongoing revival in broad risk sentiment amidst heightened hopes of a tangible improvement in US-China trade relations. Eur/Usd has survived another, deeper test of 1.1300 support where a massive 2.4 bn expiries reside and are perhaps helping to keep the headline pair cushioned against Italian/French deficit issues ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s ECB policy meeting. Meanwhile, the Aud and Loonie are feeding off the aforementioned improved risk appetite, with the former holding above 0.7200 and latter rebounding a bit further from 1.3400+ lows with the added incentive of rebounding crude prices. The Franc is meandering in a tight range between 0.9950-20 and encircling 1.1250 vs the Eur awaiting the final 2018 SNB Quarterly review tomorrow, while Usd/Jpy is equally restrained within 113.50-30 trading parameters with the topside said to be laden with Japanese offers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the Sek, firmer than expected SA CPI has underpinned the Zar around 14.3100 vs the Dollar, but the Rand may also be drawing momentum from option-related flows alongside bullish technical impulses as 1 bn expiries roll off at the 14.5000 strike today.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+1.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.3%) gained from the open with energy and tech the front-runners in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed as it benefitted from USD/JPY&rsquo;s slipstream and with the BoJ said to have purchased a record JPY 6tln of ETFs so far this year. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) were positive on hopes of a potential tariff cut on US autos and encouraging comments from US President Trump, while news that Huawei&rsquo;s CFO was released on bail and the recent better than expected lending data from China also added to the optimism. Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued with demand dampened by the gains in stocks and amid spill-over weakness from T-notes.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade higher across the board with sentiment underpinned as news flow spurs optimism regarding US-China trade relations, including reports that China submitted a proposal for review that would cut tariffs on imports of US autos to 15% from 40%. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.7%) gained from the open with energy and tech front-running the advances in Australia, while the Japanese benchmark outperforms as it gets a boost from USD/JPY&rsquo;s slipstream. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.3%) are positive on hopes of improving US-China trade relations following reports of a potential tariff cut on US autos and after comments from US President Trump that China is buying a tremendous amount of soybeans and that trade negotiations are already taking place via telephone. In addition, news that Huawei&rsquo;s CFO was released on bail and the recent better than expected lending data from China also added to the optimism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, most major pairs attempt to nurse losses against the greenback with EUR/USD recuperating after the prior day&rsquo;s drop from resistance at 1.1400 and with GBP/USD clawing back the 1.2500 handle after the recent pounding it took from PM May&rsquo;s Brexit vote retreat. Elsewhere, the increased risk appetite has dampened demand for safe-haven JPY and antipodeans have strengthened amid gains in crude and outperformance in CNH, while high-beta CAD also benefits from the risk sentiment and following the Huawei CFO bail release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are subdued with demand dampened by the gains in stocks and amid spill-over weakness from T-notes.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
