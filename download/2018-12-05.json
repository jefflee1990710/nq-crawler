There is a consensus among OPEC+, including Russia, on the need for an oil output cut next year to balance the oil market. No official agreement was reported on the size/allocations of the cut, nor on any specific timeframes; the Oman oil minister suggested the possibility of a 1mln BPD cut which would last six months, beginning January, while an OPEC delegate pointed out that some nations see an output cut below 1mln BPD as appropriate. Thus far, both figures would appear on the low-end of the 1.0mln-1.3mln range expectation. Earlier in the session, OPEC was seeking to push Russia to comply with supply reductions, and requested that the country reduces output by 300k BPD, though Russia seems to be comfortable cutting only half that amount. US OPEC sources stated that OPEC+ are mulling the idea to revert to 2016 oil production quotas next year; this followed reports in the WSJ from last week that OPEC were to plan quiet cuts to production by reaffirming output targets first agreed to in November 2016, in an attempt to avoid provoking US President Trump; this would result in Saudi Arabia cutting production to 2016 levels of just above 10mln BPD vs. current target of 11mln BPD in a more discreet manner. Meanwhile, US President Trump continues to pile the pressure on the cartel and its partners, tweeting a warning to avoid output reductions, as he does not want and does not &nbsp;see the higher oil prices; Trump said he is hopeful that OPEC will &ldquo;keep oil flows as is&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (F9) FUTURES SETTLE 36C LOWER AT USD 52.89/BBL, BRENT (F8) SETTLES USD&nbsp; LOWER AT USD .</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>US President Trump renewed his optimism on the bilateral trade talks with China noting &ldquo;very strong signals&rdquo; are being sent by the world&rsquo;s second largest economy following the &lsquo;truce&rsquo; reached at the G20, adding that he is believes &ldquo;every word&rdquo; of what Chinese President Xi told him at the meeting. Sources reported that China&#39;s UNIPEC is planning to buy US crude oil in Q1 2019, in line with US policymakers saying China would be looking to buy more energy from the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED&rsquo;S BEIGE BOOK: </strong>Most of the 12 districts reported that their economies expanded at a modest-to-moderate pace from mid-October through late November; most also reported that wage growth tended to the high side of a modest-to-moderate pace. Nearly all districts reported input costs rising faster than final goods prices; on balance prices rose at a modest pace in most districts. Labour markets tightened further across a broad range of occupations. Tariffs remained a concern for manufacturers, but a majority of districts continued to report moderate growth in the sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> The government published the full legal advice after MPs voted on Tuesday in favour of holding the government in contempt after it failed to release the full document earlier in the week. The text revealed that the backstop could mean the UK is subject to &ldquo;protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations&rdquo; warning that &ldquo;the UK would be breaking the law if it left the backstop without the EU&#39;s agreement&quot;. Some also suggested that the legal advice is bad for the DUP since it provides an explicit scenario where Great Britain leaves the backstop but not Northern Ireland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*&nbsp; ITALY: </strong>The government seems to be struggling to find enough savings to comply with EU&#39;s strict rules on fiscal budget while sticking to its promises of raising pensions spending and lowering taxes, reports in the WSJ suggested on Wednesday. In related comments, Italian PM Conte said to be ready to reduce the impact of some economic measures in the 2019 budget to avoid EU sanctions while Deputy PM Di Maio stated that the lower retirement age will be implemented in February/March with citizens income due at the end of March. Additionally, an Italian Cabinet Official announced that the government will decide on pension reform and income support costs by next week, adding that they may be able to save close to EUR 4bln from pension and income support plans. A Treasury source later reported that the government will send a revised version of the budget to Brussels by next week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB:</strong> ECB&#39;s Vasiliauskas said that at the meeting next week, the central bank will formally decide to end the asset-purchase programme while the re-investment approach will remain open ended; he also does not expect surprises in growth projections next Thursday and he is still comfortable with a balanced risk assessment in light of last week&rsquo;s agreement at the G20 as well as the Brexit deal and progress with respect to the stability and growth pact in some jurisdictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>The Bank of Canada held rates at 1.75%, as was expected. The Bank said rates will have to increase to a neutral range in order to achieve its inflation target, noting that downward historical revisions to GDP and recent macro developments indicate there may be more room for non-inflationary growth. As analysts were expecting, the BOC commented on crude, saying that due to lower Canadian oil prices and production cutbacks activity in energy, the sector will be &quot;materially weaker than expected,&quot; and stated that the incoming data suggests Canadian economy has less steam going into Q4. Elsewhere, it said that the appropriate pace of hikes will depend on factors like consumption and housing, global trade developments, persistence of oil price shock and Bank&#39;s assessment of the economy&#39;s capacity, and it will reassess these factors in their new projection for the January MPR. TD Securities argued that the BOC was noticeably dovish, and the negative spin on the economy makes a January rate hike less likely. &quot;The Bank remains committed to moving rates back to the neutral range, but it looks like the normalization process will be more gradual than anticipated,&quot; TD said, adding &quot;March remains very much live.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Deere (DE) increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to USD 0.76/shr. Facebook (FB) was revealed &ndash; by UK regulators &ndash; to have entered whitelisting agreements for user data after the platform changed in 2014/15. Qualcomm (QCOM) has introduced the Snapdragon 855, the first 5G mobile platform. Wells Fargo (WFC) is firing around 40 managers in regard to the sales scandal. Northrop Grumman (NOC) announced an additional USD 3bln share repurchase programme. Citi (C) Q4 markets revenue likely to be slightly lower versus earlier in the year, its CFO said, but added that fixed income revenue was likely down YY, while equity revenue was doing well. Citi&rsquo;s CFO warned that the bank could fall short of the 100bps operating efficiency improvement goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD, AUD, SEK: </strong>Starkly contrasting midweek sessions for the Aud, Sek, and latterly the Cad, which slumped after the BoC kept rates unchanged as widely anticipated but issued a more cautious or benign accompanying statement. The Canadian Central Bank maintained that further hikes into a neutral range are required to achieve its inflation target but was more cautious on the outlook for growth and especially activity in the key energy sector that will be significantly weaker than envisaged due to lower crude prices and production cutbacks. Hence, Usd/Cad spiked from just below 1.3300 through various layered offers above the big figure and beyond 1.3350 to just a few shy of 1.3400 having breached the previous 1.3386 ytd peak. Similarly, the Aud was undermined by a considerable miss vs consensus on Q3 growth (0.3% q/q vs 0.6% forecast and slowest pace of expansion since 2016) and recoiled further from recent near 0.7400 peaks vs the Usd to circa 0.7275, while Aud/Nzd broke below 1.0600 to around 1.0525. On the flip-side, the Swedish crown rebounded sharply on a relatively big services PMI beat and output figures that suggest the economy will recover from the unexpected Q3 contraction. The more encouraging macro releases also rekindled Riksbank hike prospects for December that have been flagging, with Eur/Sek back down through 10.2000 as a result and not from near term technical support close to 10.1550 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CHF, NZD, JPY: </strong>All weaker against the Greenback as the DXY reclaimed 97.000+ status, albeit just, on more constructive, conciliatory words from Chinese and US officials, including President Trump about trade negotiations. The single currency held above 1.1300 but could not sustain a 1.1350+ rebound amidst ongoing jitters about whether Italy&rsquo;s latest revised budget will satisfy the EU ahead of its presentation that is now due next week. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf crept back above parity and the Kiwi only just kept grasp of the 0.6900 handle even though it held up markedly better than its antipodean peer, as noted above. Usd/Jpy gradually nudged higher to circa 113.20 after bouncing ahead of 112.50 overnight when Asia-Pacific equities and broad risk sentiment were rattled by Tuesday&rsquo;s Wall Street rout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP:</strong> Perhaps surprisingly, the Pound has emerged as one of the G10 outperformers, albeit largely due to short covering and consolidation after its slide on Brexit developments yesterday, and despite more rancour as the Government revealed its legal advice on the back-stop that essentially confirmed all fears about no get out clause. Nevertheless, Cable squeezed up from fresh 2018 lows circa 1.2660 to almost 1.2800 at one stage, shrugging off a dire UK services PMI on the way, but losing momentum as the Dollar regrouped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "Daily FX Wrap: Cad whacked by BoC, Aud extends post-GDP retreat, but PMI and IP boosts Sek",
        "content": "<p>CAD/AUD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starkly contrasting midweek sessions for the Aud, Sek, and latterly the Cad, which slumped after the BoC kept rates unchanged as widely anticipated, but issued a more cautious or benign accompanying statement. The Canadian Central Bank maintained that further hikes into a neutral range are required to achieve its inflation target, but was more cautious on the outlook for growth and especially activity in the key energy sector that will be significantly weaker than envisaged due to lower crude prices and production cutbacks. Hence, Usd/Cad spiked from just below 1.3300 through various layered offers above the big figure and beyond 1.3350 to just a few shy of 1.3400 having breached the previous 1.3386 ytd peak. Similarly, the Aud was undermined by a considerable miss vs consensus on Q3 growth (0.3% q/q vs 0.6% forecast and slowest pace of expansion since 2016) and recoiled further from recent near 0.7400 peaks vs the Usd to circa 0.7275, while Aud/Nzd broke below 1.0600 to around 1.0525. On the flip-side, the Swedish crown rebounded sharply on a relatively big services PMI beat and output figures that suggest the economy will recover from the unexpected Q3 contraction. The more encouraging macro releases also rekindled Riksbank hike prospects for December that have been flagging, with Eur/Sek back down through 10.2000 as a result and not from near term technical support close to 10.1550 as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CHF/NZD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All weaker against the Greenback as the DXY reclaimed 97.000+ status, albeit just, on more constructive, conciliatory words from Chinese and US officials, including President Trump about trade negotiations. The single currency held above 1.1300, but could not sustain a 1.1350+ rebound amidst ongoing jitters about whether Italy&rsquo;s latest revised budget will satisfy the EU ahead of its presentation that is now due next week. Meanwhile, Usd/Chf crept back above parity and the Kiwi only just kept grasp of the 0.6900 handle even though it held up markedly better than its antipodean peer, as noted above. Usd/Jpy gradually nudged higher to circa 113.20 after bouncing ahead of 112.50 overnight when Asia-Pacific equities and broad risk sentiment were rattled by Tuesday&rsquo;s Wall Street rout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the Pound has emerged as one of the G10 outperformers, albeit largely due to short covering and consolidation after its slide on Brexit developments yesterday, and despite more rancour as the Government revealed its legal advice on the back-stop that essentially confirmed all fears about no get out clause. Nevertheless, Cable squeezed up from fresh 2018 lows circa 1.2660 to almost 1.2800 at one stage, shrugging off a dire UK services PMI on the way, but losing momentum as the Dollar regrouped.</p>\r\n",

The catalyst or rationale seems mainly consolidative, but a partial rebound in EU stocks may be weighing, on top of firm Italian BTPs and ongoing Brexit/UK political risk or premium. However, the Eur and Gbp have weathered latest storms and ongoing uncertainty, also pertaining to Italy&rsquo;s budget impasse with the EU, fairly well with the aid of a broad Dollar pull-back from yesterday&rsquo;s 97.000+ peaks.</p>\r\n",

(Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that China was said to be puzzled and irritated by the Trump administration&#39;s triumph rhetoric after the trade ceasefire. However, Mofcom later stated that the US-China trade meeting was successful and is confident it can be implemented, while it added that both sides will proactively push ahead with negotiations within 90-day time frame and that China will implement specific items agreed at meeting ASAP. In addition, the NDRC said government agencies signed MOC for joint effort to toughen punishment for IP theft.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stock markets were pressured following the sell off on Wall St where doubts regarding a US-China trade deal saw all US majors drop over 3% in which the S&amp;P 500 fell below its 200DMA and DJIA lost near 800 points on the day. This weighed heavily on the China-sensitive sectors in the US such as Industrials, Materials and Tech, while Financials took the biggest hit amid a slump in yields and ongoing yield-inversion. ASX 200 (-0.8%) was led lower by tech and financials with disappointing Q3 GDP adding to the downbeat tone, while Nikkei 225 (-0.5%) also finished negative albeit off worse levels as USD/JPY attempted to nurse losses. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) conformed to the downbeat tone but with the declines in the region less drastic than the bloodbath observed stateside following stronger than expected Chinese Caixin Services PMI which jumped to a 5-month. Furthermore, there was a seemingly concerted effort by some officials to dispel the trade-related doubts in which White House Trade Adviser and &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro suggested to give talks a chance and that it is premature to lose faith in US-China discussions, while Mofcom also declared the US-China trade meeting was successful although Trump remained unrelenting and reiterated his threat of tariffs if they fail to reach a deal. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially rose to levels last seen over 2 years ago amid safe-haven demand and as they tracked the upside in T-notes. However, prices then pulled back to return flat after the BoJ&rsquo;s bond buying operation in which it upped purchases in the 10yr-25yr maturities by JPY 20bln, as the bank is on course to reduce monthly purchases of superlong JGBs by JPY 150bln if it continues at the current pace given the previously announced reduction of operations for December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

China&rsquo;s Mofcom declared the US-China trade meeting as successful, although were said to be puzzled and irritated by the Trump administration&#39;s triumphant rhetoric. This came after Trump yesterday branded himself as a &lsquo;Tariff Man&rsquo; and also tweeted that the US will either have a real deal with China or no deal at all and that the US will levy major tariffs against imports of Chinese products if a deal is not made with China.

Meanwhile, AUD/NZD slumped through 1.0600 to circa 1.0525, to the benefit of the Kiwi that managed to maintain 0.6900+ vs. the buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Choppy trade for the Pound amid ongoing Brexit pandemonium after UK PM May suffered a hat-trick of defeats, giving more power to Parliament if her deal is voted down in next week&rsquo;s meaningful vote. Cable currently trying to recover having slumped to a new YTD low yesterday at 1.2659 (ahead of the psychological 1.2650), with a rebound through 1.2700 and 1.2750, albeit amidst a generally softer USD and despite a worryingly weak services PMI (headline just above 50). Similarly, Sterling has regained composure against the EUR, with the cross back down below 0.8900 even though the single currency has pared losses elsewhere amid ECB sourced talk about discussions over further policy normalisation next year. Indeed, EUR/USD is back above 1.1350 from close to 1.1300 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; USD/CAD is within striking distance of 1.3300 (vs. yesterday&rsquo;s lows of 1.3160) as retreating oil prices weigh on the Canadian currency with traders also eyeing the BoC interest rate decision later today. No change in the policy is expected though focus will be on the tone of the statement given the recently battered energy complex. For a more detailed preview, refer to our research suite or headline feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK &ndash; An improvement in Swedish services PMI alongside encouraging production data (combining to allay concerns after the surprise contraction in Q3 GDP) has given the Crown some impetus with EUR/SEK briefly dipping under 10.2000 (vs. high of 10.2432). Nordea believes Q4 GDP will probably recover after the surprise contraction in Q3, though it may not be as strong as October production suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash; Lira trades around the middle of a 5.4518-.3345 range vs. the Greenback after the CBRT set their inflation target at 5% (vs. November CPI at 21.62%) and pledged to do more to bring consumer prices back down, cushioning the TRY from wider bearish and risk averse sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Given all the above, the broad Dollar and index have handed back some of Tuesday&rsquo;s pronounced gains made amidst the Wall St. selloff, and ahead of today mark of respect day for passed President George H.W Bush.

Meanwhile, 10 year Bund yields dipped below 0.25% and the Mar contract set a new high of 163.34 briefly as the flight to safety continues, with bearish signals increasing on the Brexit front (UK Government losing 3 key parliamentary votes), a flatter US yield curve (where 2s10s fell to single digit bps on Tuesday) and extended equity weakness have offered support to the German benchmark. It is now around the 163.20 area, and from a tech standpoint comfortably with support found at 162.50, with resistance at 163.67. This flight has seen participants exit UK assets, with Gilts firmly in the red as political uncertainty is seeing UK 10 years trading near session lows at 122.95 vs. 122.82 at worst (with additional negativity in the UK from poor service PMIs), as UK rate expectations are rising and Short-Sterling vs Eurodollar and Euribor contracts move to contract highs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (-0.2%) and Brent (-0.3%) bounced off lows as the JMMC meeting goes underway, with the Omani Oil Minister hinting at a 3-6 month production cut ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s key OPEC meeting. Furthermore, The WSJ reports that OPEC delegates are concerned that Saudi and Russia are making output agreements without input from OPEC; it was also stated that the Russia-Saudi relationship was a key factor in Qatar&rsquo;s withdrawal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Markets will be looking ahead to the postponed EIA weekly data coming out tomorrow following the unexpected API build, alongside the OPEC meeting with emphasis on any decision to cut oil production that may arise. Reports today by RIA stating that OPEC wants Russia to reduce oil output by a minimum of 300k BPD. However, TASS has reported that Russia is only seeking a symbolic production cut which follows previous reports that they would only agree to a 140k BPD cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC stated that all port terminals are shut due to bad weather, with storage capacity at Zawiya (usual production of 120k BPD) affected and the 300k BPD Sharara oil field production to be cut by 50% tomorrow morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has weakened from the 5-week high reached in the previous session, as the dollar is marginally firmer. The majority of base metals have fallen due to being weighed on by US-China trade tensions following US President Trump commenting that there will have a real deal or no deal at all with China. Separately, China&rsquo;s construction steel rebar is up by over 4%, due to expectations of tighter production restrictions, bouncing back from a 7-month low in the previous session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuwaiti Oil Minister says they have not discussed the proposal to cut oil supply.

Meanwhile, 10 year Bund yields dipped below 0.25% and the Mar contract set a new high of 163.34 briefly as the flight to safety continues, with bearish signals increasing on the Brexit front (UK Government losing 3 key parliamentary votes), a flatter US yield curve (where 2s10s fell to single digit bps on Tuesday) and extended equity weakness have offered support to the German benchmark. It is now around the 163.20 area, and from a tech standpoint comfortably with support found at 162.50, with resistance at 163.67. This flight has seen participants exit UK assets, with Gilts firmly in the red as political uncertainty is seeing UK 10 years trading near session lows at 122.95 vs. 122.82 at worst (with additional negativity in the UK from poor service PMIs), as UK rate expectations are rising and Short-Sterling vs Eurodollar and Euribor contracts move to contract highs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES &nbsp;</strong><br />WTI (-0.2%) and Brent (-0.3%) bounced off lows as the JMMC meeting goes underway, with the Omani Oil Minister hinting at a 3-6 month production cut ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s key OPEC meeting. Furthermore, The WSJ reports that OPEC delegates are concerned that Saudi and Russia are making output agreements without input from OPEC; it was also stated that the Russia-Saudi relationship was a key factor in Qatar&rsquo;s withdrawal.&nbsp;<br />Markets will be looking ahead to the postponed EIA weekly data coming out tomorrow following the unexpected API build, alongside the OPEC meeting with emphasis on any decision to cut oil production that may arise. Reports today by RIA stating that OPEC wants Russia to reduce oil output by a minimum of 300k BPD. However, TASS has reported that Russia is only seeking a symbolic production cut which follows previous reports that they would only agree to a 140k BPD cut.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, Libya&rsquo;s NOC stated that all port terminals are shut due to bad weather, with storage capacity at Zawiya (usual production of 120k BPD) affected and the 300k BPD Sharara oil field production to be cut by 50% tomorrow morning.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gold has weakened from the 5-week high reached in the previous session, as the dollar is marginally firmer. The majority of base metals have fallen due to being weighed on by US-China trade tensions following US President Trump commenting that there will have a real deal or no deal at all with China. Separately, China&rsquo;s construction steel rebar is up by over 4%, due to expectations of tighter production restrictions, bouncing back from a 7-month low in the previous session.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Meanwhile, AUD/NZD slumped through 1.0600 to circa 1.0525, to the benefit of the Kiwi that managed to maintain 0.6900+ vs. the buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP &ndash; Choppy trade for the Pound amid ongoing Brexit pandemonium after UK PM May suffered a hat-trick of defeats, giving more power to Parliament if her deal is voted down in next week&rsquo;s meaningful vote. Cable currently trying to recover having slumped to a new YTD low yesterday at 1.2659 (ahead of the psychological 1.2650), with a rebound through 1.2700 and 1.2750, albeit amidst a generally softer USD and despite a worryingly weak services PMI (headline just above 50). Similarly, Sterling has regained composure against the EUR, with the cross back down below 0.8900 even though the single currency has pared losses elsewhere amid ECB sourced talk about discussions over further policy normalisation next year. Indeed, EUR/USD is back above 1.1350 from close to 1.1300 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD &ndash; USD/CAD is within striking distance of 1.3300 (vs. yesterday&rsquo;s lows of 1.3160) as retreating oil prices weigh on the Canadian currency with traders also eyeing the BoC interest rate decision later today. No change in the policy is expected though focus will be on the tone of the statement given the recently battered energy complex. For a more detailed preview, refer to our research suite or headline feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SEK &ndash; An improvement in Swedish services PMI alongside encouraging production data (combining to allay concerns after the surprise contraction in Q3 GDP) has given the Crown some impetus with EUR/SEK briefly dipping under 10.2000 (vs. high of 10.2432). Nordea believes Q4 GDP will probably recover after the surprise contraction in Q3, though it may not be as strong as October production suggests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &ndash; Lira trades around the middle of a 5.4518-.3345 range vs. the Greenback after the CBRT set their inflation target at 5% (vs. November CPI at 21.62%) and pledged to do more to bring consumer prices back down, cushioning the TRY from wider bearish and risk averse sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY &ndash; Given all the above, the broad Dollar and index have handed back some of Tuesday&rsquo;s pronounced gains made amidst the Wall St. selloff, and ahead of today mark of respect day for passed President George H.W Bush. DXY pivoting 97.000 within a range 97.206-96.827.</p>\r\n",

However, Brexit remains firmly in the spotlight and on that note the Government&rsquo;s full legal advice will be published sometime from 11-11.30GMT, ahead of PMQs and the daunting prospect of damage limitation for May.</p>\r\n",

However, the front month future, which has now switched to March 2019 from December this year ahead of expiry, has regrouped and extended gains from yesterday&rsquo;s 162.96 Eurex close to 38 ticks at 163.34 following confirmation of weaker EU equity opens, while the corresponding cash yield declines further and through the key/psychological 0.25% level, albeit just. The broadly bullish tone in debt markets comes on the back of another rally in US Treasuries and long end performance as initial post-G20 positivity about US/China/global trade prospects continues to wane.

(Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were initial reports that China was said to be puzzled and irritated by the Trump administration&#39;s triumph rhetoric after the trade ceasefire. However, Mofcom later stated that the US-China trade meeting was successful and is confident it can be implemented, while it added that both sides will proactively push ahead with negotiations within 90-day time frame and that China will implement specific items agreed at meeting ASAP.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stock markets were pressured following the sell off on Wall St where doubts regarding a US-China trade deal saw all US majors drop over 3% in which the S&amp;P 500 fell below its 200DMA and DJIA lost near 800 points on the day. This weighed heavily on the China-sensitive sectors in the US such as Industrials, Materials and Tech, while Financials took the biggest hit amid a slump in yields and ongoing yield-inversion. ASX 200 (-0.8%) was led lower by tech and financials with disappointing Q3 GDP adding to the downbeat tone, while Nikkei 225 (-0.6%) also finished negative albeit off worse levels as USD/JPY attempted to nurse losses. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.7%) conformed to the downbeat tone but with the declines in the region less drastic than the bloodbath observed stateside following stronger than expected Chinese Caixin Services PMI which jumped to a 5-month. Furthermore, there was a seemingly concerted effort by some officials to dispel the trade-related doubts in which White House Trade Adviser and &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro suggested to give talks a chance and that it is premature to lose faith in US-China discussions, while Mofcom also declared the US-China trade meeting was successful although Trump remained unrelenting and reiterated his threat of tariffs if they fail to reach a deal. Finally, 10yr JGBs initially rose to levels last seen over 2 years ago amid safe-haven demand and as they tracked the upside in T-notes. However, prices then pulled back to return flat after the BoJ&rsquo;s bond buying operation in which it upped purchases in the 10yr-25yr maturities by JPY 20bln, as the bank is on course to reduce monthly purchases of superlong JGBs by JPY 150bln if it continues at the current pace given the previously announced reduction of operations for December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net neutral daily position.

In addition, UK Parliament voted that the government is in contempt over Brexit legal advice and ordered to publish advice immediately. (Newswires) Paul Brand of ITV highlighted that we are now firmly in minority government territory and that the DUP no longer provides confidence or supplies votes. UK Parliament leader Leadsom said the government is to publish document of full legal advice on Brexit on Wednesday, while The Times Deputy Political Editor Sam Coates suggested there could be a row looming over which legal advice the government releases if it is a short version briefly put before cabinet or something more substantial. (Newswires/Twitter)<br /><br />UK PM May pledged a more formal role for Parliament on her Brexit deal and she will work with Parliament to prepare the mandate for next steps of negotiations, while she also commented that a 2nd referendum wouldn&#39;t bring the country together.

(Corriere Della Sera)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remained firmer following the prior day&rsquo;s gains in which the DXY reclaimed the 97.00 level amid safe-haven demand and after the recent bullish tone on the economy by Fed&rsquo;s Williams. This also coincided with broad losses across its major counterparts with EUR/USD firmly below 1.1400 and GBP/USD failing to hold on to the 1.2700 handle after the government&rsquo;s trifecta of defeats at Parliament yesterday. Elsewhere, high-beta and commodity-linked currencies AUD, NZD and CAD were subdued amid the risk averse tone and decline in oil prices, with AUD/USD the underperformer following the GDP miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian GDP (Q3) Q/Q 0.3% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. 0.9%).

Elsewhere, gold was dampened amid a firmer greenback but with losses also stemmed on safe-haven support and copper was flat which provided some much-needed respite from this week&rsquo;s slump.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Weekly Crude Stocks (30 Nov) +5.36mln vs. Exp. -0.9mln (Prev. +3.453mln)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC delegates are said to be concerned that Saudi and Russia are making output agreements without OPEC input, while an official said that Saudi-Russia relationship was a key reason for Qatar&rsquo;s withdrawal.

The 10yr yield hit a 3-month low at 2.8830% and the 30yr yield fell to 3.1278%, overall representing the largest drop since May. Yields on the short-end of the curve were lower by less than 1bps while the 30yr yield was lower by c.1bps at settlement. Much attention is on the inversion of the curve, Barron&rsquo;s has noted that a true inversion would involve the short and long-ends of the curve, and how the five-year maturities &lsquo;don&rsquo;t really count&rsquo;; 2s10s hit 9.32bps the lowest since 2007, but Barron&rsquo;s noted that the last 10 times 2s10s has inverted, there were three occasions when there was no recession. Goldman Sachs noted that it doesn&rsquo;t believe that investors ought to overly fear a flat yield curve, either as a signal or a cause of a recession, describing it as a &ldquo;sheep in wolf&rsquo;s clothing&rdquo;. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 15 ticks higher at 120-03.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Discount Rate Minutes showed 12 Fed banks favoured no discount rate change and that several districts continued strength in spending and confidence.

This weighed heavily on the China-sensitive sectors in the US such as Industrials, Materials and Tech, while Financials took the biggest hit amid a slump in yields and ongoing yield-inversion. ASX 200 (-1.2%) is led lower by tech and financials with disappointing Q3 GDP adding to downbeat tone, while Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) is off worse levels as USD/JPY attempts to nurse losses. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) are negative but with the declines in the region less drastic than the bloodbath observed stateside following stronger than expected Chinese Caixin Services PMI which jumped to a 5-month. Furthermore, there was a seemingly concerted effort by officials to dispel the trade-related doubts in which White House Trade Adviser and &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Navarro suggested to give talks a chance and that it is premature to lose faith in US-China discussions, while Mofcom said the US-China trade meeting was successful and that both sides will proactively push ahead with negotiations within the 90-day time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains firmer following the prior day&rsquo;s gains in which the DXY reclaimed the 97.00 level amid safe-haven demand and recent bullish tone on the economy by Fed&rsquo;s Williams. This also coincided with broad losses across its major counterparts with EUR/USD firmly below 1.1400 and GBP/USD just about holding on to the 1.2700 handle after the government&rsquo;s trifecta of defeats at Parliament yesterday in which MPs voted that the government was in contempt over Brexit legal advice and ordered it to publish advice immediately, while MPs also voted to provide parliament more power over the next steps if PM May&#39;s deal is voted down on Dec 11th. Elsewhere, high-beta and commodity-linked currencies AUD, NZD and CAD are subdued amid the risk averse tone and decline in oil prices, with AUD/USD the underperformer following the GDP miss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs rose to levels last seen over 2 years ago with prices underpinned by safe-haven demand and as they tracked the upside in T-notes. The BoJ were also in the market today in which it upped purchases in the 10yr-25yr maturities by JPY 20bln, but is on course to reduce monthly purchases of superlong JGBs by JPY 150bln if it continues at the current pace given the previously announced reduction of operations this month.</p>\r\n",
