NOTE: the equity performance comes in spite of Trump&rsquo;s recent comments, where he said that there was no specific timeframe to reach a deal, and was not overly optimistic that this week&rsquo;s low-level trade talks would bear fruit. In terms of earnings, Toll Brothers (TOL) provided a boost to other home names, like as Lennar (LEN), DR Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM), following a beat on both top and bottom line, as well as reporting home deliveries up 18% to 2246 homes. JM Smucker (SJM) was lower after poor earnings, where it cut its FY guidance. &nbsp;Elsewhere, Financial names such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were all hit today following the announcement that JP Morgan (JPM) is to release a new and free investing app next week. Tesla (TSLA) was removed from Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s ratings list, which was then followed by Fox&rsquo;s Gasparino tweeting they have been retained as advisors for the privatisation, and Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake are to be partners. SPX +0.21% at 2863, NDX +0.35% at 7397, DJI +0.25% at 25822.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex began to slide just after the European open and continued to drift lower into the US session as equities climbed higher with the SPX hitting an all-time high. Investors are now awaiting the FOMC Minutes due to be released tomorrow and Fed&rsquo;s Powell conference at Jackson Hole later in the week. Amid decent volume, most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps whilst the short and long end of the curve were higher by c.2bps. 2s10s. 2s5s and 2s30s were wider by c.1bps at settlement. US 10-year T-notes settled ticks 5+ ticks lower at 120-14+.</p>\r\n",

The two teams led by Wang Shouwen and David Malpass will resume trade negotiations on Wednesday after talks stalled in May as two sides failed to reach an agreement the previous three rounds. Officials have said that the focus this week will be on a list of more than 140 specific demands which were originally drafted by the Trump administration for the first round of talks in May. Elsewhere, reports via the WSJ announced Trump auto tariff timetable is likely to slip amid Europe and NAFTA talks, with US Commerce Secretary Ross commenting and noting it is not clear that the report on auto tariff recommendations will be coming this month. In separate news, Russia&#39;s Lavrov announced Britain has rejected all of Moscow&#39;s offers to discuss bilateral ties. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>FED:</strong> Fed Governor Powell has no plans to ever let Trump&rsquo;s comments impact the central bank&rsquo;s rate hike campaign, people close to the Fed told Politico. This came in the context of yesterday&rsquo;s comments made by US President Trump who expressed frustration regarding Fed rate hikes, saying that he expected Fed chair Powell to be a &ldquo;cheap money&rdquo; Fed chair, and he was &ldquo;not thrilled&rdquo; with the central bank tightening policy amid alleged currency manipulation by the Chinese and Europeans. Fed&rsquo;s Kaplan (Non-Voter) said Fed should raise interest rates gradually to a neutral level; he sees 3 to 4 more hikes before the level is reached, and once the Fed is there, he said he would be inclined to step-back and assess the outlook. Kaplan believes the central bank has met its goals and should raise interest rates gradually to the neutral level. He forecasts a GDP growth at 3% this year. On the yield curve, Kaplan said it suggests that the US is in the late stage of the economic cycle and added he will continue to watch it as he judges the pace of hikes. He also said he will monitor any impacts from global instability. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>GEOPOLITICS:</strong> It was reported that at the recent summit Trump and Putin did not discuss sanction easing, but the Kremlin is said to welcome comments from Trump regarding a possible easing of sanctions. Later, the US imposed fresh sanctions for Russian cyber-related activities. However, US Senate Majority Leader McConnell said that the chances are slim for the possibility of any congressional action in September against Russia if it interferes ahead of the midterms. On the Iranian front, German Foreign Minister said to keep Iran nuclear deal alive, Europe must establish payment systems that are independent of the US. Elsewhere, South Korean Trade Minister said South Korea and US are expected to sign a revision of a bilateral trade deal in September. Also, sources voiced that North Korea has reportedly agreed to provide key info to US about nuclear warheads and secret test sites.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>BREXIT: </strong>Cable had been strengthening throughout most of the session as traders awaited updates from UK&rsquo;s Brexit Secretary Raab and EU&rsquo;s Chief Brexit Negotiator Barnier; at &nbsp;the press conference, there was essentially little by way of new information, but Barnier did state that the EU is not working towards a no-deal Brexit, but it does have to prepare for that scenario, with Raab stating the two are prepared for all eventualities. Barnier also announced they need a legally operational Irish backstop, and said they are entering final stages of the negotiations, with the two agreeing to increase the pace of talks. Raab did say progress has been made, but there are still significant issues which are needed to overcome.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />*<strong> SPX +0.21% at 2863, NDX +0.35% at 7397, DJI +0.25% at 25822. SECTORS:</strong> Energy +0.49%, Materials +0.39%, Industrials +0.75%, Cons Discretionary +0.89%, Cons Staples -0.77%, Healthcare -0.02%, Financials +0.37%, Tech +0.07%, Telecoms +0.68%, Utilities -0.72%.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>INDICES:</strong> The SPX hit an all-time intra-day high today above 2873, taking out the high from 26 January, as well as equalling the longest ever bull market run, as Wall St carried on the gains from Friday and Monday which stemmed from the announcement that the US and China have set a roadmap to resolve trade disputes by November. NOTE: the equity performance comes in spite of Trump&rsquo;s recent comments, where he said that there was no specific timeframe to reach a deal, and was not overly optimistic that this week&rsquo;s low-level trade talks would bear fruit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />* <strong>EARNIGNS:</strong> Toll Brothers (TOL) provided a boost to other home names, like as Lennar (LEN), DR Horton (DHI) and Pulte Group (PHM), following a beat on both top and bottom line, as well as reporting home deliveries up 18% to 2246 homes. JM Smucker (SJM) was lower after poor earnings, &nbsp;where it cut its FY guidance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />* <strong>STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Financial names such as Charles Schwab (SCHW), E-Trade (ETFC) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD) were all hit today following the announcement that JP Morgan (JPM) is to release a new and free investing app next week. Tesla (TSLA) was removed from Morgan Stanley&rsquo;s ratings list, which was then followed by Fox&rsquo;s Gasparino tweeting they have been retained as advisors for the privatisation, and Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake are to be partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />*<strong> WTI (U8) FUTURES SETTLE 92C HIGHER AT USD 67.35/BBL, BRENT (V8) FUTURES SETTLE 42C HIGHER AT USD 72.63/BBL.</strong> Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday with traders citing hopes that low-level trade talks between China and the US will lead to a more positive outcome when/if senior policymakers meet (talks are set to resume tomorrow), as well as continuing concerns regarding Iranian supply, as the US prepares to choke off the nation from international markets. In&nbsp; news flow, industry sources reported Southern Iraq oil exports in August so far have averaged 3.6-3.7mln bpd, which would represent a record high for southern Iraq oil exports. Today&rsquo;s API data is expected to show crude stocks is expected to show a 1.5mln barrel draw, Cushing stocks are seen building by 519k (according to Genscape), distillates are seen building by 1.5mln, while gasoline is expected to draw by 500k. As a reminder, WTI September contract (U8) expires today.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />*<strong> US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED TICKS 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-14+.</strong> The Treasury complex began to slide just after the European open and continued to drift lower into the US session as equities climbed higher with the SPX hitting an all-time high. Investors are now awaiting the FOMC Minutes due to be released tomorrow and Fed&rsquo;s Powell conference at Jackson Hole later in the week. Amid decent volume, most of the action was concentrated in the belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.3bps whilst the short and long end of the curve were higher by c.2bps. 2s10s. 2s5s and 2s30s were wider by c.1bps at settlement. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>USD:</strong> The USD has been trading-off Trump&rsquo;s criticism of the Fed, and has been languishing on Tuesday, helping the EUR rise to a whisker of 1.16, while the DXY was supported by the 95.00 area. The buck was more mixed against haven FX, however, with gains against the yen; but the Swissy, meanwhile, was mixed, making gains against the dollar, but succumbed to the EUR&rsquo;s strength. Attention now falls on the FOMC meeting minutes, released on Wednesday, and Jackson Hole, which begins Thursday. Given the extreme short positioning in USTs, some desks have been flagging up the risks of a short-squeeze in the Treasuries should the Fed err on the dovish side, which could beget a bout of USD weakness. With the said, the base case remains for the FOMC to reiterate a path of gradual hikes, which will likely do little to spur the dollar any further from these levels. ING has argued that the path of the buck is upwards, unless the Fed were to judge that financial conditions have seen an unwarranted tightening.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>GBP:</strong> For the most part, the pound has been taking its cue from the dollar move, with analysts suggesting it is a preferable way to play the dollar&rsquo;s weakness given that it has been so unloved as of late, while positioning dynamics also provides support. Commerzbank&rsquo;s analysts have also noted the lack of downside protection being taken out in Sterling, despite further suggestions that Brexit talks still ace significant challenges. Today&rsquo;s negotiations provided little by way of new information, allowing cable to ride the dollar&rsquo;s weakness to trade above 1.29.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />* <strong>EMFX:</strong> In spite of concerns about the domestic situation in South Africa, the ZAR prints three straight days of gains, with today&rsquo;s courtesy of a weaker dollar and more constructive risk tone. IFR&rsquo;s analysts warn that the rand may therefore be punching above its weight, and are keeping an expectant eye out for downside. The BRL, on the other side, was one of the worst performing major EMFX currencies, with traders citing polls which showed that Sao Paulo governor Alckmin, a market friendly candidate, was failing to gain traction in&nbsp;<br />election polls; USDBRL breached 4.00 to the upside for the first time since March 2016.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />*<strong> COMING-UP:</strong> FOMC August 2018 Meeting Minutes published at 1900 BST/1400 EDT on 22nd August 2018. FOMC held rates in August, the release isn&rsquo;t expected to be a major market mover. Comments on Fed independence and yield curve inversion will garner focus, as well as for any statements defending the central bank&rsquo;s independence. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19907/download\">For the full RANsquawk preview click here.</a>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

That said, broader GBP performance against its major peers was slightly more contained with EUR/GBP seeing little in the way of traction for a bulk of the session before eventually heading south towards 0.8950. Brexit will remain a key focus for the remainder of the week with Barnier and Raab due to brief press at 1615BST today and the UK government due to unveil their technical notes in preparation of a potential no-deal Brexit on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD garnered a bulk of the focus overnight with the USD-inspired move to the upside in AUD/USD (session high of 0.7365) capped by domestic political uncertainty after the Australian PM managed to escape a leadership challenge (was later described as a &lsquo;dead man walking&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A calmer one for TRY today with the pair swinging between minor gains and losses after US President Trump yesterday criticised Turkey by stating that he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release. No solution appears to be in sight for the Pastor&rsquo;s release but even his return to the US might do little to placate investor sentiment given Turkey&rsquo;s current account woes and central bank inertia.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) was the worst performer and was pressured by weakness in energy, financials and mining names with losses in industry giant BHP following disappointing earnings results. In addition, political uncertainty added to dampened tone in Australia after PM Turnbull survived a leadership challenge, although is still seen to be at risk and some have even suggested to be a dead man walking after 42% of the party voted against him. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was initially dampened by a firmer currency but then gradually recovered, while Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) traded higher as earnings optimism helped shrug-off early indecision from further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and Trump trade pessimism. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower and retreated back below 150.00 with prices subdued amid an improvement of risk tone in Tokyo, while a mixed 20yr auction also failed to spur demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has no time-frame for ending China trade dispute and does not anticipate much coming from the trade talks with China this week. US President Trump also accused China and Europe of currency manipulation and stated that when the US places tariffs on China, China artificially devalues its currency. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8360 (Prev. 6.8718)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian PM Turnbull survived a Liberal Party leadership challenge by 48 to 35 votes, which was brought on by Australian Home Affairs Minister Dutton who later stepped down. This followed reports that PM Turnbull abandoned his energy policy and conceded the legislation could not pass parliament given the coalition&rsquo;s 1-seat majority and opposition from within the Liberal Party led by former PM Abbott, which reports had noted casted large doubts over Turnbull&rsquo;s future as party leader and PM. (SMH/CNBC)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA minutes from August 7th meeting stated the board viewed no strong case for a near-term adjustment in rates and that the next move is likely to be a hike if progress is made on unemployment and inflation, The minutes added the central bank is to be source of stability and confidence by keeping rates steady, while it also noted that AUD had weakened a little but TWI remains within range of last 2 years and that risks of faster Fed hikes could weaken AUD and support the economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Foreign Secretary Hunt is said to call for further sanctions from the EU on Russia. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release and that he helped Israel to free a Turkish citizen for the pastor&#39;s release. US President Trump said he would consider lifting Russian sanctions if Moscow took steps to cooperate with US on issues such as Syria and Ukraine, while he also stated it is fine if Iranian President Rouhani wants to meet him but that he could not care less if not. US President Trump later added that it is likely will have a 2nd summit with North Korean leader Kim. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC Vice Governor said CNY will not be used as a weapon in trade frictions and is primarily decided by demand and supply. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s latest tirade on the USD has given FX markets some much needed traction after yesterday&rsquo;s somewhat contained session. In his latest attack on the firmer USD, Trump has once again shifted blame onto the &lsquo;independent&rsquo; Fed Chair Powell but stating that he was &lsquo;not thrilled&rsquo; with the FOMC for lifting rates, adding that the Fed should do more to support the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, the DXY sits on a 95 handle in EU trade with the greenback having given back some key levels to its major peers. More specifically, EUR/USD has reclaimed 1.1500 to the upside and went as high as 1.1543 overnight before pulling back to just above 1.1500 where around EUR 646mln of option expiries reside; EZ-specific newsflow and data remains light. JPY has failed to benefit much from the softer USD with the move in USD/JPY below 110.00 short-lived as the pair now resides in close proximity to USD 1.6bln of expiries between 110.00-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP could be the one to watch for today&rsquo;s session as talks in Brussels continue between EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier and UK Brexit secretary Raab. In-fitting with most majors, GBP is firmer vs. the greenback thus far and comfortably on a 1.2800 handle but not showing much in the way of outperformance vs. its peers with EUR/GBP currently flat. Talks between Barnier and Raab are unlikely to provide markets with much in the way of a breakthrough as prospects of a deal by October remains doubtful. Thursday could instead provide the next major development for Brexit with the UK government due to unveil their technical notes in preparation of a potential no-deal Brexit; public or political backlash to this could provide the next headache for May et al.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, AUD was a key focus overnight after extending yesterday&rsquo;s move above 0.7300, largely off the back of USD weakness with gains capped by domestic political uncertainty. As a reminder, Australian PM Turnbull survived a Liberal Party leadership challenge by 48 to 35 votes, which was brought on by Australian Home Affairs Minister Dutton who later stepped down. This followed reports that PM Turnbull abandoned his energy policy and conceded the legislation could not pass parliament given the coalition&rsquo;s 1-seat majority and opposition from within the Liberal Party led by former PM Abbott, which reports had noted casted large doubts over Turnbull&rsquo;s future as party leader and PM. RBA minutes overnight were a non-event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &lsquo;calmer&rsquo; start to the session for TRY with USD/TRY (only!) up 1.0% thus far after US President Trump yesterday criticised Turkey by stating that he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release. TRY will continue to remain sensitive to any developments regarding the Pastor with Trump no-doubt wanting to get a &lsquo;win&rsquo; in the eyes of the US electorate by securing his release without conditions. That said, questions remain over what long-term impact the release of the Pastor will have on the TRY given Turkey&rsquo;s current account woes and central bank inertia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mostly higher (Eurostoxx 50 +0.7%) with the FTSE 100 (-0.3%) underperforming, weighed by a firmer sterling and heavyweight BHP reported a 37% fall in profits due to a write-down on its US onshore oil and gas assets. Energy and Telecom names are underperforming while IT names outperform. Looking at individual stocks, Aggreko (+4.7%) and Bayer (+2.5%) are faring well following broker upgrades. Atlantia (+3.4%) remains in focus, company shares are taking a breather after plunging over 9% yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mixed start to the session thus far for EZ paper with Bunds and BTPs once again diverging as the IT/GE spread tightens. Bunds started the session on the backfoot with the German 10yr slipping to a session low of 163.39 after opening at circa 163.60 with the modest uptick in sentiment placing some modest pressure on core markets. Bunds pared losses slightly to reclaim 163.50 to the upside ahead of Germany 2yr supply which drew a softer than prior b/c (1.6 vs. Prev. 2.5) but did little to shake the complex. From an Italian perspective, today&rsquo;s session has offered little in the way of new thinking into the populist administration&rsquo;s stance on EU budgetary requirements with markets using the slightly more positive broader market tone thus far to buy BTPs with the Italian 10yr yield back below 3.0% for the first time since August 10th. Gilts trade modestly lower, in-fitting with the broader theme across core paper with the latest borrowing figures from the UK unable to provide any traction in Gilts with the release highlighting the largest surplus in public finances since 2000; supply today came in the form of a 2028 I/L Gilt which proved to be a non-event. USTs relatively flat with paper unfazed by the US Commander-in-Chiefs attempts to force the hand of the Fed</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (Unch) and Brent (Unch) trade without a firm direction, while concern grows over the potential impacts of the US-Sino trade disputes. US President Trump stated last night that he has no time frames for ending the China trade disputes. Traders are noting the rise in WTI is supported by the tightening outlook for fuel in the coming months. Of note: US offered 11mln barrels of sour crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve yesterday. This release of oil could offset some expected supply shortfalls as a result of US sanctions on Iran. Traders will be keeping an eye on the API weekly crude inventories today. Elsewhere, gold (+0.3%) is higher as the yellow metal moves with the dollar, while base metals benefit from the weaker dollar.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) was the worst performer and was pressured by weakness in energy, financials and mining names with losses in industry giant BHP following disappointing earnings results. In addition, political uncertainty added to dampened tone in Australia after PM Turnbull survived a leadership challenge, although is still seen to be at risk and some have even suggested to be a dead man walking after 42% of the party voted against him. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) was initially dampened by a firmer currency but then gradually recovered, while Hang Seng (+0.6%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.3%) traded higher as earnings optimism helped shrug-off early indecision from further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and Trump trade pessimism. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower and retreated back below 150.00 with prices subdued amid an improvement of risk tone in Tokyo, while a mixed 20yr auction also failed to spur demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has no time-frame for ending China trade dispute and does not anticipate much coming from the trade talks with China this week. US President Trump also accused China and Europe of currency manipulation and stated that when the US places tariffs on China, China artificially devalues its currency.

(Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8360 (Prev. 6.8718)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian PM Turnbull survived a Liberal Party leadership challenge by 48 to 35 votes, which was brought on by Australian Home Affairs Minister Dutton who later stepped down. This followed reports that PM Turnbull abandoned his energy policy and conceded the legislation could not pass parliament given the coalition&rsquo;s 1-seat majority and opposition from within the Liberal Party led by former PM Abbott, which reports had noted casted large doubts over Turnbull&rsquo;s future as party leader and PM. (SMH/CNBC)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA minutes from August 7th meeting stated the board viewed no strong case for a near-term adjustment in rates and that the next move is likely to be a hike if progress is made on unemployment and inflation, The minutes added the central bank is to be source of stability and confidence by keeping rates steady, while it also noted that AUD had weakened a little but TWI remains within range of last 2 years and that risks of faster Fed hikes could weaken AUD and support the economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Foreign Secretary Hunt is said to call for further sanctions from the EU on Russia. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release and that he helped Israel to free a Turkish citizen for the pastor&#39;s release. US President Trump said he would consider lifting Russian sanctions if Moscow took steps to cooperate with US on issues such as Syria and Ukraine, while he also stated it is fine if Iranian President Rouhani wants to meet him but that he could not care less if not. US President Trump later added that it is likely will have a 2nd summit with North Korean leader Kim. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC Vice Governor said CNY will not be used as a weapon in trade frictions and is primarily decided by demand and supply. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s latest tirade on the USD has given FX markets some much needed traction after yesterday&rsquo;s somewhat contained session. In his latest attack on the firmer USD, Trump has once again shifted blame onto the &lsquo;independent&rsquo; Fed Chair Powell but stating that he was &lsquo;not thrilled&rsquo; with the FOMC for lifting rates, adding that the Fed should do more to support the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, the DXY sits on a 95 handle in EU trade with the greenback having given back some key levels to its major peers. More specifically, EUR/USD has reclaimed 1.1500 to the upside and went as high as 1.1543 overnight before pulling back to just above 1.1500 where around EUR 646mln of option expiries reside; EZ-specific newsflow and data remains light. JPY has failed to benefit much from the softer USD with the move in USD/JPY below 110.00 short-lived as the pair now resides in close proximity to USD 1.6bln of expiries between 110.00-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP could be the one to watch for today&rsquo;s session as talks in Brussels continue between EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier and UK Brexit secretary Raab. In-fitting with most majors, GBP is firmer vs. the greenback thus far and comfortably on a 1.2800 handle but not showing much in the way of outperformance vs. its peers with EUR/GBP currently flat. Talks between Barnier and Raab are unlikely to provide markets with much in the way of a breakthrough as prospects of a deal by October remains doubtful. Thursday could instead provide the next major development for Brexit with the UK government due to unveil their technical notes in preparation of a potential no-deal Brexit; public or political backlash to this could provide the next headache for May et al.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, AUD was a key focus overnight after extending yesterday&rsquo;s move above 0.7300, largely off the back of USD weakness with gains capped by domestic political uncertainty. As a reminder, Australian PM Turnbull survived a Liberal Party leadership challenge by 48 to 35 votes, which was brought on by Australian Home Affairs Minister Dutton who later stepped down. This followed reports that PM Turnbull abandoned his energy policy and conceded the legislation could not pass parliament given the coalition&rsquo;s 1-seat majority and opposition from within the Liberal Party led by former PM Abbott, which reports had noted casted large doubts over Turnbull&rsquo;s future as party leader and PM. RBA minutes overnight were a non-event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &lsquo;calmer&rsquo; start to the session for TRY with USD/TRY (only!) up 1.0% thus far after US President Trump yesterday criticised Turkey by stating that he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release. TRY will continue to remain sensitive to any developments regarding the Pastor with Trump no-doubt wanting to get a &lsquo;win&rsquo; in the eyes of the US electorate by securing his release without conditions. That said, questions remain over what long-term impact the release of the Pastor will have on the TRY given Turkey&rsquo;s current account woes and central bank inertia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mostly higher (Eurostoxx 50 +0.7%) with the FTSE 100 (-0.3%) underperforming, weighed by a firmer sterling and heavyweight BHP reported a 37% fall in profits due to a write-down on its US onshore oil and gas assets. Energy and Telecom names are underperforming while IT names outperform. Looking at individual stocks, Aggreko (+4.7%) and Bayer (+2.5%) are faring well following broker upgrades. Atlantia (+3.4%) remains in focus, company shares are taking a breather after plunging over 9% yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mixed start to the session thus far for EZ paper with Bunds and BTPs once again diverging as the IT/GE spread tightens. Bunds started the session on the backfoot with the German 10yr slipping to a session low of 163.39 after opening at circa 163.60 with the modest uptick in sentiment placing some modest pressure on core markets. Bunds pared losses slightly to reclaim 163.50 to the upside ahead of Germany 2yr supply which drew a softer than prior b/c (1.6 vs. Prev. 2.5) but did little to shake the complex. From an Italian perspective, today&rsquo;s session has offered little in the way of new thinking into the populist administration&rsquo;s stance on EU budgetary requirements with markets using the slightly more positive broader market tone thus far to buy BTPs with the Italian 10yr yield back below 3.0% for the first time since August 10th. Gilts trade modestly lower, in-fitting with the broader theme across core paper with the latest borrowing figures from the UK unable to provide any traction in Gilts with the release highlighting the largest surplus in public finances since 2000; supply today came in the form of a 2028 I/L Gilt which proved to be a non-event. USTs relatively flat with paper unfazed by the US Commander-in-Chiefs attempts to force the hand of the Fed</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (Unch) and Brent (Unch) trade without a firm direction, while concern grows over the potential impacts of the US-Sino trade disputes. US President Trump stated last night that he has no time frames for ending the China trade disputes. Traders are noting the rise in WTI is supported by the tightening outlook for fuel in the coming months. Of note: US offered 11mln barrels of sour crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve yesterday. This release of oil could offset some expected supply shortfalls as a result of US sanctions on Iran. Traders will be keeping an eye on the API weekly crude inventories today. Elsewhere, gold (+0.3%) is higher as the yellow metal moves with the dollar, while base metals benefit from the weaker dollar.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>To download the report, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/19905/download\">here</a><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can now do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.<br />To subscribe simply check the box next to &quot;Email these reports&quot; under the desired category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s latest tirade on the USD has given FX markets some much needed traction after yesterday&rsquo;s somewhat contained session. In his latest attack on the firmer USD, Trump has once again shifted blame onto the &lsquo;independent&rsquo; Fed Chair Powell but stating that he was &lsquo;not thrilled&rsquo; with the FOMC for lifting rates, adding that the Fed should do more to support the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, the DXY sits on a 95 handle in EU trade with the greenback having given back some key levels to its major peers. More specifically, EUR/USD has reclaimed 1.1500 to the upside and went as high as 1.1543 overnight before pulling back to just above 1.1500 where around EUR 646mln of option expiries reside; EZ-specific newsflow and data remains light. JPY has failed to benefit much from the softer USD with the move in USD/JPY below 110.00 short-lived as the pair now resides in close proximity to USD 1.6bln of expiries between 110.00-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP could be the one to watch for today&rsquo;s session as talks in Brussels continue between EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier and UK Brexit secretary Raab. In-fitting with most majors, GBP is firmer vs. the greenback thus far and comfortably on a 1.2800 handle but not showing much in the way of outperformance vs. its peers with EUR/GBP currently flat. Talks between Barnier and Raab are unlikely to provide markets with much in the way of a breakthrough as prospects of a deal by October remains doubtful. Thursday could instead provide the next major development for Brexit with the UK government due to unveil their technical notes in preparation of a potential no-deal Brexit; public or political backlash to this could provide the next headache for May et al.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, AUD was a key focus overnight after extending yesterday&rsquo;s move above 0.7300, largely off the back of USD weakness with gains capped by domestic political uncertainty. As a reminder, Australian PM Turnbull survived a Liberal Party leadership challenge by 48 to 35 votes, which was brought on by Australian Home Affairs Minister Dutton who later stepped down. This followed reports that PM Turnbull abandoned his energy policy and conceded the legislation could not pass parliament given the coalition&rsquo;s 1-seat majority and opposition from within the Liberal Party led by former PM Abbott, which reports had noted casted large doubts over Turnbull&rsquo;s future as party leader and PM. RBA minutes overnight were a non-event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A &lsquo;calmer&rsquo; start to the session for TRY with USD/TRY (only!) up 0.5% thus far after US President Trump yesterday criticised Turkey by stating that he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release. TRY will continue to remain sensitive to any developments regarding the Pastor with Trump no-doubt wanting to get a &lsquo;win&rsquo; in the eyes of the US electorate by securing his release without conditions. That said, questions remain over what long-term impact the release of the Pastor will have on the TRY given Turkey&rsquo;s current account woes and central bank inertia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mostly higher (Eurostoxx 50 +0.4%) with the FTSE 100 (-0.3%) underperforming, weighed by a firmer sterling and heavyweight BHP reported a 37% fall in profits due to a write-down on its US onshore oil and gas assets. Energy and Telecom names are underperforming while IT names outperform. Looking at individual stocks, Aggreko (+5.1%) and Bayer (+2.4%) are faring well following broker upgrades. Atlantia (+3.6%) remains in focus, company shares are taking a breather after plunging over 9% yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A mixed start to the session thus far for EZ paper with Bunds and BTPs once again diverging as the IT/GE spread tightens. Bunds started the session on the backfoot with the German 10yr slipping to a session low of 163.39 after opening at circa 163.60 with the modest uptick in sentiment placing some modest pressure on core markets. Bunds pared losses slightly to reclaim 163.50 to the upside ahead of upcoming 2yr supply from Germany at 1030BST. From an Italian perspective, today&rsquo;s session has offered little in the way of new thinking into the populist administration&rsquo;s stance on EU budgetary requirements with markets using the slightly more positive broader market tone thus far to buy BTPs with the Italian 10yr yield back below 3.0% for the first time since August 10th. Gilts trade modestly lower, in-fitting with the broader theme across core paper with the latest borrowing figures from the UK unable to provide any traction in Gilts with the release highlighting the largest surplus in public finances since 2000; supply today comes in the form of a 2028 I/L alongside GE supply. USTs relatively flat with paper unfazed by the US Commander-in-Chiefs attempts to force the hand of the Fed</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI (Unch) and Brent (Unch) trade without a firm direction, while concern grows over the potential impacts of the US-Sino trade disputes. US President Trump stated last night that he has no time frames for ending the China trade disputes. Traders are noting the rise in WTI is supported by the tightening outlook for fuel in the coming months. Of note: US offered 11mln barrels of sour crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve yesterday. This release of oil could offset some expected supply shortfalls as a result of US sanctions on Iran. Traders will be keeping an eye on the API weekly crude inventories today. Elsewhere, gold (+0.3%) is higher as the yellow metal moves with the dollar, while base metals benefit from the weaker dollar.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-1.0%) was the worst performer and was pressured by weakness in energy, financials and mining names with losses in industry giant BHP following disappointing earnings results. In addition, political uncertainty added to dampened tone in Australia after PM Turnbull survived a leadership challenge, although is still seen to be at risk and some have even suggested to be a dead man walking after 42% of the party voted against him. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) was initially dampened by a firmer currency but then gradually recovered, while Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.4%) traded higher as earnings optimism helped shrug-off early indecision from further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and Trump trade pessimism. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower and retreated back below 150.00 with prices subdued amid an improvement of risk tone in Tokyo, while a mixed 20yr auction also failed to spur demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he has no time-frame for ending China trade dispute and does not anticipate much coming from the trade talks with China this week. US President Trump also accused China and Europe of currency manipulation and stated that when the US places tariffs on China, China artificially devalues its currency. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 50bln via 7-day reverse repos. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8360 (Prev. 6.8718)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government is to announce a new export strategy today in which it seeks to boost exports to 35% of GDP from 30% last year. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France&rsquo;s Macron and Germany&#39;s Merkel will be meeting in Paris early September to discuss Brexit, according to a French official. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY took a hit and retreated below 96.00 following a renewed tirade by US President Trump on the Fed in which he stated that he disagrees with the Fed&rsquo;s decision to hike interest rates and that he is not thrilled with Fed Chair Powell for doing so. This underpinned the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts across the board with gains in EUR/USD exacerbated on a break through 1.1500 and which saw GBP/USD reclaim the 1.2800 handle to the upside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped below 110.00 for the first time in almost 2 months and the PBoC also took a swipe at the USD by setting a firmer reference rate, while AUD/USD extended on gains but with advances capped amid political risks and an unsurprising RBA minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian PM Turnbull survived a Liberal Party leadership challenge by 48 to 35 votes, which was brought on by Australian Home Affairs Minister Dutton who later stepped down. This followed reports that PM Turnbull abandoned his energy policy and conceded the legislation could not pass parliament given the coalition&rsquo;s 1-seat majority and opposition from within the Liberal Party led by former PM Abbott, which reports had noted casted large doubts over Turnbull&rsquo;s future as party leader and PM. (SMH/CNBC)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA minutes from August 7th meeting stated the board viewed no strong case for a near-term adjustment in rates and that the next move is likely to be a hike if progress is made on unemployment and inflation, The minutes added the central bank is to be source of stability and confidence by keeping rates steady, while it also noted that AUD had weakened a little but TWI remains within range of last 2 years and that risks of faster Fed hikes could weaken AUD and support the economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were mixed overnight with WTI crude futures relatively flat to hold on to the prior day&rsquo;s marginal gains. Elsewhere, the metals complex was more eventful with gold underpinned by USD weakness following President Trump&rsquo;s jawboning against Fed rate hikes and with copper supported by the positive risk tone in China which helped the red metal ignore the pressure in Dalian iron futures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese firms are reportedly shifting to the use of Iranian oil tankers to circumvent potential sanctions on US oil and ensure supply. (Twitter)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DoE offered 11mln barrels sour crude for sale from the US reserves.

(Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he thought he had a deal with Turkey for Pastor Brunson&rsquo;s release and that he helped Israel to free a Turkish citizen for the pastor&#39;s release. US President Trump said he would consider lifting Russian sanctions if Moscow took steps to cooperate with US on issues such as Syria and Ukraine, while he also stated it is fine if Iranian President Rouhani wants to meet him but that he could not care less if not. US President Trump later added that it is likely will have a 2nd summit with North Korean leader Kim. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As US traders were getting to their desks, a slight risk-off sentiment was prevailing, and yields were edging lower. The latest CFTC data released Friday showed specs hold a record net short position in Treasuries, which prompted Doubline&rsquo;s Gundlach to warn of the potential for a massive short squeeze; attention, therefore is on the general risk sentiment (Turkey is away this week following its Downgrade, for Eid; China related trade news flow seems positive, however) as well as the Fed minutes and Jackson Hole later in the week. Informa reported that buying action today was from real money accounts continuing to buy as tariffs and EM issues remain in the spotlight (though tensions have noticeably eased, broadly speaking). The front part of the curve (2s5s, 2s10s, 2s30s) narrowed, while 5s10s, 5s320s and 10s30s was more-or-less unchanged at settlement. US 10-year T-notes settled 12 ticks higher at 120-20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he disagrees with the Fed&rsquo;s decision to hike interest rates and that he is not thrilled with Fed Chair Powell for doing so, while he also said Fed should be more accommodating and should give him some more help. Furthermore, there were earlier reports that US President Trump is said to have been complaining about Fed raising rates and lamented that Powell hasn&rsquo;t been a cheap money Fed chair which he expected, according to three people familiar with the matter. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bostic (voter, dovish) said the economy no longer needs the stimulus it required before and is doing pretty well with GDP strong and the unemployment rate historically very low. Bostic added the Fed is worried about flatness of yield curve, while he also stated the Fed is on a gradual path to get rates back to neutral and that he still favours 3 hikes for 2018. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump declined to say whether he will undergo interview with Special Counsel Mueller&#39;s team which he stated could be a perjury trap. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Agricultural Secretary Perdue said a trade war is needed to get exports up and to get a level field. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia-Pac markets are mixed as region fails to sustain the positive lead from Wall St where stocks edged a 3rd consecutive gain and the S&amp;P 500 finished around 15 points from all-time highs. ASX 200 (-0.9%) is the worst performer dragged by weakness in energy, financials and mining names with industry giant BHP suffering following disappointing earnings results. In addition, political uncertainty adds to dampened tone in Australia after PM Turnbull survived a leadership challenge, although is seen to be far from out of the woods and some have even suggested to be a dead man walking with 42% of the party voting against him. Elsewhere, Nikkei 225 (Unch) is dampened by a firmer currency, while Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) are varied amid further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and recent pessimism by US President Trump regarding this week&rsquo;s US-China trade discussions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY took a hit and retreated below 96.00 following a renewed tirade by President Trump on the Fed in which he stated that he disagrees with the Fed&rsquo;s decision to hike interest rates and that he is not thrilled with Fed Chair Powell for doing so. This underpinned the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts across the board with gains in EUR/USD exacerbated on a break through 1.1500 and with GBP/USD reclaiming the 1.2800 handle to the upside. Elsewhere, USD/JPY slipped below 110.00 for the first time in almost 2 months and the PBoC also took a swipe at the USD by setting a firmer reference rate, while AUD/USD extended on gains but with advances capped amid political risks and an uneventful RBA minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are marginally lower in which prices retreated back below 150.00, with demand subdued amid an indecisive tone in the region and ahead of a 20yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
