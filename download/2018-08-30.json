Furthermore, Trump said he has no regrets appointing Powell as Fed chair and stated he is not being accommodated by the Fed in trade disputes but he is not sure the currency should be controlled by a politician. In addition, Trump stated that AG Sessions job is safe until at least the November elections, while he also declared there will be no pay rises for public sector workers in 2019. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that a trade agreement with Canada may come by Friday or within a period of time but it will occur, while there were also reports that Canada&rsquo;s Foreign Minister Freeland continues to be optimistic about NAFTA talks and commented that the both sides are showing constructive attitudes and have a lot of work to do in a short time.

Dollar General, on the other hand, beat on both lines, as well as SSS coming in above expectations, but still traded lower at the open and losses were extended as the conference call seemed cautious after the CEO expects to see pressure on its gross margins in H2. Campbell Soup (CPB) was lower after it provided FY19 EPS and revenue guidance beneath expectations, EPS and revenue were higher than expectations this quarter. Salesforce (CRM) beat on top and bottom lines, however forecast its Q3 EPS beneath expectations, thus was lower on Thursday. Following its earnings, it was reported that Campbell Soup is planning to sell its international business and refrigerated-foods unit which together collects USD 2.1bln in annual revenue, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. US auto names were hit after the EU said it is willing to scrap tariffs on all industrial products, including cars in its trade talks with the US, as it would be reciprocal and competition would increase due to the easier access of German cars, with names such as Volkswagen (VOW3 GY) and BMW (BMW GY) benefiting on the news. Electronic Arts (EA) was hit after cutting FY19 bookings guidance to USD 5.2bln from USD 5.55bln due to the 5 week launch delay of Battlefield V game. Henry Schein (HSIC) also lower as it is to incur a USD 38.5mln pre-tax charge, and expects to be hit by USD 0.19/shr at its next earnings report. SPX -0.4% at 2901, NDX -0.2% at 7643, DJI -0.5% at 25987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bid in Treasuries in the pre-market was attributed to worries around the looming deadline for the US and Canada to reach a trade deal by COB on Friday; with that said, the bid was modest, with Treasury yields down by between 1-2bps, amid constructive commentary from the Canadian foreign minister. In later trade, the TPLEX found further buyers on reports that Trump could announce $200bln of tariffs on China early next week, though the decision was not final. Even so, yields were only lower by 2-3bps by settlement. As is the norm, curve spreads narrowed, with 2s10s falling to 20.1bps. US 10-year T-notes settled 5+ ticks higher at 120-08+.</p>\r\n",

The news, reported in the US afternoon, weighed on equities, added USD strength; notably, the AUD sank to fresh session lows, while the USDCNH pair spiked to 6.8760. Earlier in the day, China&rsquo;s Commerce Ministry on Thursday said the US has agreed to maintain communication regarding the next round of talks, following the latest dialogue between the two counties, which was said to be constructive on the current trade subjects. China also said it believes the issues with the US can only be resolved through talks, as equals, and added that it will stick to a steady opening of its economy regardless of US actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EU TRADE: </strong>EU&#39;s Malmstrom said the bloc is willing to scrap tariffs on all industrial products, including cars, in its trade talks with the US with the news lifting EU car names in the European session, while weighing on some of the US automakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NAFTA: </strong>Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said they have had very intensive works with the US overnight and she continues to be optimistic about NAFTA talks as both parts are both showing constructive attitudes, though she stressed there is a lot of work to do in a short time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>Russia&#39;s Kremlin said there has been no signals that the US wants to reach a compromise to avoid a new round of sanctions. Separately, a UN watchdog reported Iran has stayed within key limits of the nuclear deal which includes the uranium enrichment level and stock. In other news, YONHAP reported China and North Korea are said to increase their economic exchanges, with this coming after Trump stated in a tweet he feels strongly North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China due to US-China trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CANADIAN GDP </strong>came in unchanged in June, against expectations for 0.1% growth in the month; sending the yy headline lower to 2.4% from 2.6%. Scotiabank notes that the soft print comes amid an inventory de-stocking as well as a surge in imports driven by unusual developments at Canadian refineries which together subtracted 1.5ppts to headline GDP. They, however, see this rebounding in Q3 as pipelines capacity eventually recovers, contributing to growth in this sector. The hike trajectory for the BoC remains fragile, as the latest data was on the weak side and NAFTA developments continue to be monitored; the implied probability of a rate hike next week fell to 18% vs 22% pre the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US PCE </strong>rose by 0.1% in June, as expected, pushing the yy rate to 2.3%, slightly above the Fed&rsquo;s inflation target. Core PCE was also in line, rising by 0.2% in June, with the yy rate at 2%. The smaller increase in the core measure was attributed to different airfare prices sampling as well as a smaller weight of used car prices in the PCE. Analysts at UBS note Thursday&rsquo;s report should comfort FOMC members, and therefore, are confident that the Fed will hike rates at its next meeting in September (implied probability is around 95%) though UBS sees policy tightening pausing in December as tariffs come into effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PERSONAL INCOME &amp; CONSUMPTION </strong>were both in line with expectations rising by 0.3% and 0.4% whilst the Adj. for inflation figure increased by 0.2% slightly missing the 0.3% consensus. Oxford Economics noted that overall the trend remain strong as consumer spending is outpacing growth and contributing to lower savings, which fell by 0.1 ppt to 6.7%; they expect the trend to continue and forecast a solid 2.9% growth in consumer spending in Q3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US JOBLESS CLAIMS </strong>rose slightly last week posting at 213k just below expectations of 215k and remain well within the 211k-222k range seen since mid-July. Barclays notes claims have &lsquo;displayed a high degree of stability&rsquo; recently and emphasize that this indicates improvements in the labour market as both claims and unemployment are at their lowest levels since the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.4% at 2901, NDX -0.2% at 7643, DJI -0.5% at 25987. </strong>SECTORS: Energy -0.3%, Materials -1.2%, Industrials -0.7%, Cons Discretionary -0.6%, Cons Staples -0.3%, Healthcare -0.1%, Financials -0.8%, Tech -0.3%, Telecoms -0.4%, Utilities +0.1%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EARNINGS: </strong>Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) were both hit today; Dollar Tree EPS and revenue fell, in line with expectations, but it cut its FY18 EPS &amp; revenue forecasts. Dollar General, on the other hand, beat on both lines, as well as SSS coming in above expectations, but still traded lower at the open and losses were extended as the conference call seemed cautious after the CEO expects to see pressure on its gross margins in H2. Campbell Soup (CPB) was lower after it provided FY19 EPS and revenue guidance beneath expectations, EPS and revenue were higher than expectations this quarter. Salesforce (CRM) beat on top and bottom lines, however forecast its Q3 EPS beneath expectations, thus was lower on Thursday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Following its earnings, it was reported that Campbell Soup is planning to sell its international business and refrigerated-foods unit which together collects USD 2.1bln in annual revenue, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. US auto names were hit after the EU said it is willing to scrap tariffs on all industrial products, including cars in its trade talks with the US, as it would be reciprocal and competition would increase due to the easier access of German cars, with names such as Volkswagen (VOW3 GY) and BMW (BMW GY) benefiting on the news. Electronic Arts (EA) was hit after cutting FY19 bookings guidance to USD 5.2bln from USD 5.55bln due to the 5 week launch delay of Battlefield V game. Henry Schein (HSIC) also lower as it is to incur a USD 38.5mln pre-tax charge, and expects to be hit by USD 0.19/shr at its next earnings report. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLED 74C HIGHER AT $70.25/BBL; BRENT (V8) SETTLED 63C HIGHER AT $77.77/BBL. </strong>In a thin day for news flow, WTI and Brent both trader higher, with traders continuing to cite the expected tightening in the market later this year, as a result of US sanctions on Iran&rsquo;s crude. The market has also been supported by DOE data on Wednesday, which showed a surprise draw in headline crude inventories in the week. &ldquo;OPEC+ producers may be signing a charter committing to stabilising prices, but the market continues to have doubts that would mean enough additional barrels to fully offset the expected drop in Iranian output,&rdquo; Citi said. Elsewhere, it was officially confirmed that OPEC+ compliance fell to 109% in the latest month, versus 120% previously, signalling that although producers are raising production, they are still in aggregate over-complying with the supply cut agreement. And elsewhere, sources suggested that Russian oil output averaged 11.208mln BPD between the 1-29 August, versus 11.22mln in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10-YEAR T-NOTES SETTLED 5+ TICKS HIGHER AT 120-08+. </strong>The bid in Treasuries in the pre-market was attributed to worries around the looming deadline for the US and Canada to reach a trade deal by COB on Friday; with that said, the bid was modest, with Treasury yields down by between 1-2bps, amid constructive commentary from the Canadian foreign minister. In later trade, the TPLEX found further buyers on reports that Trump could announce $200bln of tariffs on China early next week, though the decision was not final. Even so, yields were only lower by 2-3bps by settlement. As is the norm, curve spreads narrowed, with 2s10s falling to 20.1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY was surviving several wobbles and another strong sell for month-end bank model to revisit highs just under 95.000 from sub-94.500 lows, albeit largely due to the misfortune of others as only the JPY among majors looks set to end Thursday&rsquo;s EU session with net gains (back above 111.50 vs around 111.90 at one stage). However, in later US trade, the buck surged on news Trump was moving towards applying $200bln of tariffs on China, with an announcement possible early next week. The DXY trades up[, heading into the APAC session, though is yet to reclaim 95.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>More drastic action from the Argentine Central Bank via a whopping hike in the benchmark rate to 60% from 45% appeared to merely pile more pressure on the ARS before a pledge not to reverse tightening before December pushed USDARS back from fresh all-time highs of 39.000 towards 35.000. No such intervention from the CBRT, as the TRY lurched vs the USD after sourced reports that the Deputy Governor plans to quit and join Turkey&rsquo;s Development Bank instead, while the Rand&rsquo;s travails continued (USDZAR up around 14.80+ at one stage) even though the SA Government stated its opposition to land grabbing and added it would forbid appropriation. The BRL saw more weakness ahead of Brazilian GDP data, and contagion spread across the region, but the Rouble was relatively resilient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD: </strong>The Kiwi has been the G10 laggard all day in wake of plunging NZ business confidence overnight (to -50.3 in August and a 10-year low), and NZDUSD is now extending losses through 0.6650, while the AUDNZD cross has rebounded further above 1.0950 even though AUDUSD is only just off recent lows (circa 0.7275 on 2 occasions of late).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another mad session for the Loonie and a virtual full big figure swing vs the USD from 1.2900 to 1.3000 as Canadian GDP data underwhelmed and further cut September BoC rate hike expectations, reversing earlier NAFTA and oil price-related strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, GBP: </strong>The single currency saw a bit more contagion from TRY selling and Italian jitters ahead of Fitch&rsquo;s ratings review on Friday as the agency sounded quite concerned in the run up and BTPs came under renewed pressure. EURUSD recoiled from 1.1700+ levels and briefly below 1.1650, while EURGBP slipped under a key chart level (21 DMA at 0.8977), as Cable held up better around the 1.3000 level on heightened Brexit deal hopes (if not by the end of October deadline then mid-November).</p>\r\n",

Eur/Usd recoiled from 1.1700+ levels and briefly below 1.1650, while Eur/Gbp slipped under a key chart level (21 DMA at 0.8977), as Cable held up better around the 1.3000 level on heightened Brexit deal hopes (if not by the end of October deadline then mid-November).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More drastic action from the Argentine Central Bank via a whopping hike in the benchmark rate to 60% from 45% appeared to merely pile more pressure on the Ars before a pledge not to reverse tightening before December pushed Usd/Ars back from fresh all time highs of 39.000 towards 35.000. No such intervention from the CBRT, as the Lira lurched below 6.8200 vs the Usd after sourced reports that the Deputy Governor plans to quit and join Turkey&rsquo;s Development Bank instead, while the Rand&rsquo;s travails continued (Usd/Zar up around 14.7000 at one stage) even though the SA Government stated its opposition to land grabbing and added it would forbid appropriation. The Real saw more weakness ahead of Brazilian GDP data, and contagion spread across the region, but the Rouble was relatively resilient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DXY survived several wobbles and another strong sell for month end bank model to revisit highs just under 95.000 from sub-94.500 lows, albeit largely due to the misfortune of others as only the JPY among majors looks set to end Thursday&rsquo;s EU session with net gains (back above 111.50 vs around 111.90 at one stage).</p>\r\n",

Indeed, the 10 year bond has now been up to 162.66, with some stops seen once 162.54 was breached, but not quite enough to seriously threaten 162.68-73, which is next on the radar for a few technicians. Meanwhile, Gilts remain capped ahead of 122.00 and the previous 121.96 Liffe peak, and US Treasuries are mildly firmer with the curve flatter again, while the DXY dipped just under 94.500, albeit fleetingly.</p>\r\n",

(Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are largely on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.7%). Germany&rsquo;s DAX 30 (-1.0%) is underperforming its peers with the likes of German auto names, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and heavyweight Bayer pressuring the index. Sector wise, telecom names underperform despite Bouygues (+3.16%) taking a spot at the top of the Stoxx 600 following earnings, with the likes of Vodafone and Telecom Italia weighing on the sector. Material names are also a laggard, in-fitting with price action in the base metal complex, while Elekta (-8.8%) shares plummeted on disappointed figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Some loss of momentum on less positive Brexit talk from Germany&rsquo;s Finance Minister who is unsure whether there will be a withdrawal agreement and doesn&rsquo;t rule out a disorderly UK departure from the EU, but Sterling remains supported and not too discouraged by weaker than expected mortgage and consumer credit data. Cable is holding around the 1.3000 level vs just shy of 1.3050 at best, while Eur/Gbp has continued its retreat from close to 0.9100 peaks on Wednesday through 0.9000 and testing the 21 DMA around 0.8977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - Yet more angst for the antipodean Dollars, but with the Kiwi now the clear underperformer in wake of a sharp deterioration in NZ business sentiment overnight (to worst levels in a decade), with Nzd/Usd only just holding 0.6650 and Aud/Nzd firmly back over 1.0900 to circa 1.0950. Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.7300, but still feeling the squeeze from West Pac&rsquo;s hike in lending rates and hardly helped by a plunge in Q2 Aussie capex vs forecasts for a modest pick-up in spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie continues to benefit from NAFTA deal prospects and a possible Friday accord along the lines of the US-Mexico agreement, while firm crude prices are also supportive as Usd/Cad trades within a 1.2935-00 range ahead of Canadian GDP data for Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has retreated after another rally above 1.1700 vs the Greenback on broadly benign German state CPI and Spanish inflation data, but remains underpinned at the top of a daily cloud formation between 1.1655-81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Both largely flat vs the Usd amidst mixed individual month end rebalancing signals, with Usd/Jpy easing back from a higher range high towards 111.50 and the Franc meandering either side of 0.9700 in relatively tight confines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Another day, but more misery for the region&rsquo;s 2 whipping boys as the Lira and Rand depreciate further &ndash; Usd/Try now over 6.6000 and Usd/Zar around 14.6500. Elsewhere, the Peso has pared some of its NAFTA-related gains to trade below 19.0000 vs the Buck, but its Argentine counterpart is sharply underperforming even though several forms of intervention were deployed on Wednesday to try and stop the rot &ndash; Usd/Ars closed almost 8% higher yesterday just under 33.8980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have eased back from fresh recovery highs of 162.49 and 121.96 respectively, and&nbsp; without even turning to the charts 162.50 and 122.00 are obvious hurdles from a psychological standpoint. However, for the German benchmark there could be a degree of acknowledgement to Italian auctions and a sigh of relief rather than rapture from BTPs that reversed from near 124.00 peaks to just below 123.50 ahead of the results, but are now back in positive territory again, albeit just. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain relatively unimpressed and pretty flat halfway between overnight session ranges ahead of top-tier data like PCE and weekly claims ahead of next Friday&rsquo;s NFP, and month end tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade higher following the larger than expected draw in DoE crude inventories while concern looms of tightening supply by year-end. According to the WSJ, Iran&rsquo;s oil exports are expected to drop from 2.7mln BPD in June to 1.5mln BPD in September ahead of US sanctions (coming into effect on November 5th). Otherwise, news flow for the complex has remained light thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is lower on the day, having tested USD 1200/oz to the downside and currently close to the lower end of the range, while copper is on the backfoot amid underperformance in its largest consumer, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that maintaining aluminium tariffs levels is necessary, although he signed a proclamation permitting targeted relief from steel quotas for Argentina, Brazil &amp; South Korea, as well as relief for Argentina on aluminium quotas.

(Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German state CPIs printed slight downticks in the YY rates (with the exception of Bavaria which was unchanged from the prior), so the bias vs. consensus for the national figure could be to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Consumer Confidence Final Jul -1.9 vs. Exp. -1.9 (Prev. -1.9)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Industrial Sentiment Jul 5.5 vs. Exp. 5.5 (Prev. 5.8)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Services Sentiment Jul 14.7 vs. Exp. 15.1 (Prev. 15.3)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Business Climate Jul 1.22 vs. Exp. 1.28 (Prev. 1.29, Rev. 1.30)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Economic Sentiment Jul 111.6 vs. Exp. 111.9 (Prev. 112.1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITICAL</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump tweeted a statement that he feels strongly North Korea is under tremendous pressure from China due to US-China trade dispute but believes his relationship with North Korea leader Kim is very good and warm. (Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are largely on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.7%). Germany&rsquo;s DAX 30 (-1.0%) is underperforming its peers with the likes of German auto names, Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank and heavyweight Bayer pressuring the index. Sector wise, telecom names underperform despite Bouygues (+3.16%) taking a spot at the top of the Stoxx 600 following earnings, with the likes of Vodafone and Telecom Italia weighing on the sector. Material names are also a laggard, in-fitting with price action in the base metal complex, while Elekta (-8.8%) shares plummeted on disappointed figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Some loss of momentum on less positive Brexit talk from Germany&rsquo;s Finance Minister who is unsure whether there will be a withdrawal agreement and doesn&rsquo;t rule out a disorderly UK departure from the EU, but Sterling remains supported and not too discouraged by weaker than expected mortgage and consumer credit data. Cable is holding around the 1.3000 level vs just shy of 1.3050 at best, while Eur/Gbp has continued its retreat from close to 0.9100 peaks on Wednesday through 0.9000 and testing the 21 DMA around 0.8977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - Yet more angst for the antipodean Dollars, but with the Kiwi now the clear underperformer in wake of a sharp deterioration in NZ business sentiment overnight (to worst levels in a decade), with Nzd/Usd only just holding 0.6650 and Aud/Nzd firmly back over 1.0900 to circa 1.0950. Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.7300, but still feeling the squeeze from West Pac&rsquo;s hike in lending rates and hardly helped by a plunge in Q2 Aussie capex vs forecasts for a modest pick-up in spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD - The Loonie continues to benefit from NAFTA deal prospects and a possible Friday accord along the lines of the US-Mexico agreement, while firm crude prices are also supportive as Usd/Cad trades within a 1.2935-00 range ahead of Canadian GDP data for Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR - The single currency has retreated after another rally above 1.1700 vs the Greenback on broadly benign German state CPI and Spanish inflation data, but remains underpinned at the top of a daily cloud formation between 1.1655-81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF - Both largely flat vs the Usd amidst mixed individual month end rebalancing signals, with Usd/Jpy easing back from a higher range high towards 111.50 and the Franc meandering either side of 0.9700 in relatively tight confines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - Another day, but more misery for the region&rsquo;s 2 whipping boys as the Lira and Rand depreciate further &ndash; Usd/Try now over 6.6000 and Usd/Zar around 14.6500. Elsewhere, the Peso has pared some of its NAFTA-related gains to trade below 19.0000 vs the Buck, but its Argentine counterpart is sharply underperforming even though several forms of intervention were deployed on Wednesday to try and stop the rot &ndash; Usd/Ars closed almost 8% higher yesterday just under 33.8980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bunds and Gilts have eased back from fresh recovery highs of 162.49 and 121.96 respectively, and&nbsp; without even turning to the charts 162.50 and 122.00 are obvious hurdles from a psychological standpoint. However, for the German benchmark there could be a degree of acknowledgement to Italian auctions and a sigh of relief rather than rapture from BTPs that reversed from near 124.00 peaks to just below 123.50 ahead of the results, but are now back in positive territory again, albeit just. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain relatively unimpressed and pretty flat halfway between overnight session ranges ahead of top-tier data like PCE and weekly claims ahead of next Friday&rsquo;s NFP, and month end tomorrow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent futures trade higher following the larger than expected draw in DoE crude inventories while concern looms of tightening supply by year-end. According to the WSJ, Iran&rsquo;s oil exports are expected to drop from 2.7mln BPD in June to 1.5mln BPD in September ahead of US sanctions (coming into effect on November 5th). Otherwise, news flow for the complex has remained light thus far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, gold is lower on the day, having tested USD 1200/oz to the downside and currently close to the lower end of the range, while copper is on the backfoot amid underperformance in its largest consumer, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump stated that maintaining aluminium tariffs levels is necessary, although he signed a proclamation permitting targeted relief from steel quotas for Argentina, Brazil &amp; South Korea, as well as relief for Argentina on aluminium quotas.

        "content": "<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some loss of momentum on less positive Brexit talk from Germany&rsquo;s Finance Minister who is unsure whether there will be a withdrawal agreement and doesn&rsquo;t rule out a disorderly UK departure from the EU, but Sterling remains supported and not too discouraged by weaker than expected mortgage and consumer credit data. Cable is holding around the 1.3000 level vs just shy of 1.3050 at best, while Eur/Gbp has continued its retreat from close to 0.9100 peaks on Wednesday through 0.9000 and testing the 21 DMA around 0.8977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet more angst for the antipodean Dollars, but with the Kiwi now the clear underperformer in wake of a sharp deterioration in NZ business sentiment overnight (to worst levels in a decade), with Nzd/Usd only just holding 0.6650 and Aud/Nzd firmly back over 1.0900 to circa 1.0950. Aud/Usd is pivoting 0.7300, but still feeling the squeeze from West Pac&rsquo;s hike in lending rates and hardly helped by a plunge in Q2 Aussie capex vs forecasts for a modest pick-up in spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Loonie continues to benefit from NAFTA deal prospects and a possible Friday accord along the lines of the US-Mexico agreement, while firm crude prices are also supportive as Usd/Cad trades within a 1.2935-00 range ahead of Canadian GDP data for Q2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The single currency has retreated after another rally above 1.1700 vs the Greenback on broadly benign German state CPI and Spanish inflation data, but remains underpinned at the top of a daily cloud formation between 1.1655-81.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both largely flat vs the Usd amidst mixed individual month end rebalancing signals, with Usd/Jpy easing back from a higher range high towards 111.50 and the Franc meandering either side of 0.9700 in relatively tight confines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another day, but more misery for the region&rsquo;s 2 whipping boys as the Lira and Rand depreciate further &ndash; Usd/Try now over 6.6000 and Usd/Zar around 14.6500. Elsewhere, the Peso has pared some of its NAFTA-related gains to trade below 19.0000 vs the Buck, but its Argentine counterpart is sharply underperforming even though several forms of intervention were deployed on Wednesday to try and stop the rot &ndash; Usd/Ars closed almost 8% higher yesterday just under 33.8980.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets traded mixed as the initial impetus from Wall St where the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq posted a 4th consecutive day of records and where sentiment was underpinned by better than expected US GDP data as well as NAFTA optimism, was eventually clouded by weakness in China. ASX 200 (+0.2%) was led by outperformance in telecoms on confirmation of the TPG Telecom-Vodafone Hutchison M&amp;A deal although upside in the index was capped by weakness in financials and following disappointing capex data, while Nikkei 225 (+0.2%) gapped above the 23k level at the open which it then failed to sustain. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) and Hang Seng (-0.7%) were subdued amid continued PBoC liquidity inaction and the ongoing US-China trade dispute, while President Trump also blamed China for the difficulties related to North Korea. Finally, 10yr JGBs were lower amid the mild gains in Japan and after the 2yr JGB auction failed to spur demand despite stronger results.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.2%) is higher with telecoms outperforming on confirmation of the TPG Telecom-Vodafone Hutchison M&amp;A deal although the index is off best intraday levels amid weakness in financials and following disappointing capex data, while Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) gapped above the 23k level at the open which it then failed to sustain. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (-0.3%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) are subdued amid continued PBoC liquidity inaction and the ongoing US-China trade dispute, while President Trump also blamed China for the difficulties related to North Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is lacklustre in which the DXY consolidates near the 94.50 level, while its major counterparts hold on to the prior day&rsquo;s gains with EUR/USD just about staying afloat at the 1.1700 handle and with GBP/USD at a 3-week high after EU&rsquo;s Brexit Negotiator Barnier suggested the EU were prepared to offer an unprecedented partnership with the UK. Elsewhere, antipodeans were the laggards on weak data releases with NZD/USD dragged below 0.6700 after Business Confidence declined to its lowest in a decade and with AUD/USD hampered by a miss on Private Capex and Building Approval data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are lower amid the mild gains in Japan and with demand also dampened ahead of a 2yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
