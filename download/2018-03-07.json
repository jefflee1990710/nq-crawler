        "content": "<p><br />ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he had asked China to produce a plan for how to reduce its surplus with the US by USD 1bln. (Newswires/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Manufacturing Activity (Q4) 2.8% (Prev. 0.5%). (Newswires)<br />New Zealand Manufacturing Sales (Q4) 1.0% (Prev. 0.3%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said we expect the EU transition period to be formalised in March at the EU leaders meeting, while an EU official stated they expect to have a Brexit deal in October and hopes a trade deal can be struck during transition. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Council published Brexit guidelines which stated that Free Trade Agreement could include trade in services but cannot allow participation in the single market, while it also stated that leaving customs union means trade will have frictions. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Parliament Head Tajani stated that individual sector participation in EU market post-Brexit is impossible, although added that that a future trade deal with Britain may be more extensive than that with Japan or Canada. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB official said the Governing Council has no objection to De Guindos Vice Presidency at the central bank.

However, some remain cautious ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s likely singing-off of tariffs by Trump (1700 GMT), and although analysts argue that any impact of the steel/aluminium tariffs are likely manageable, they will likely continue to signal the Trump administrations protectionist view, which has the potential to structurally weaken the dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD: It has been a roller-coaster of a day for CAD. Overnight, the Loonie slipped to 1.2875 (versus highs over 1.30 on Tuesday); before the BOC meeting, the USDCAD was slightly above 1.29, though spiked higher in a knee-jerk reaction, before retracing; when the White House said the Canadians may&nbsp;&nbsp; get a carve-out, the CAD strengthened, with USDCAD falling to the 1.29 handle once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR: The currency held gains above 1.24, but action was muted ahead of the ECB tomorrow, while the JPY has made its way back up to the 106.00 handle heading into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC Rate Decision 1.25% vs. Exp. 1.25% (Prev. 1.25%). (Newswires)<br />Bank of Canada said higher are rates likely warranted over time, but some continued policy accommodation will likely be needed to keep economy close to potential and inflation on target.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US EIA Weekly Crude Stocks (2 Mar) 2.408M vs. Exp. 2.723M (Prev. 3.019M). (Newswires)<br />US Crude production rose 0.84% to 10.369mln bpd</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House stated that there is potential for exemptions on the tariff plans for Mexico and Canada, while it added that exemptions are to be decided on a country by country basis. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian PM Trudeau said US President Trump was clear that he was focused on progressing NAFTA, and if a good deal can be reached, there would be no need for tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Beige Book reported persistent tightness across the country and that prices increased in all districts. It also stated that most noted &#39;moderate inflation&#39; and that wages picked up at moderate pace. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish) said he now sees 3 hikes this year vs. Prev. estimate of 2 hikes this year, due to fiscal stimulus. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Goods Trade Balance (R) (Jan) -75.26B (Prev. -74.40B)<br />US ADP National Employment (Feb) 235k vs. Exp. 195k (Prev. 234k, Rev. 244k)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sharp losses witnessed overnight after US futures reopened were largely retraced in US trade, as concerns about Gary Cohn&rsquo;s departure from the White House were faded. While any tariffs would likely weigh on companies that use steel and aluminium in its production cycle, analysts have argued that the impact will likely be manageable, on the whole. Perhaps part of the reason that equities pared back may have been Peter Navarro (Trump advisor, protectionist) suggesting that he was not a candidate to replace Cohn. And in late trade, stocks were given a boost after the White House said Canada and Mexico may get carve-outs, signalling that Trump may not pursue the most aggressive form of tariff implementation. SPX -0.05% at 2727, DJI -0.33% at 24,802, IXIC +0.34% at 7397.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were flat, trading sideways for most of the session. There was some selling pressure in late US trade after the US said there may be exemptions from tariffs, that would likely be detailed on Thursday or Friday. On the whole, however, the TPLEX weathered the &lsquo;Cohn concerns&rsquo; in a ore resilient manner. Tomorrow, the Treasury announces auction sizes for next week&rsquo;s 3s/10s/30s auctions (exp $62b). Yields little changed (+/- 1bps), while major curve spreads were also little changed (+/- 1bps). US 10yr T-note futures settled 1 tick lower at 120-20+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>To download the full report with day-ahead preview, please click <a href=\"/research_sheets/18738/download\">here</a></strong><br />If you would like to subscribe to receive the research sheets directly in your inbox, you can no do so under the <a href=\"/research_sheets\">Research Suite</a> section of the portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><strong>SNAPSHOT: US equities flat, Treasuries flat, DXY flat, crude lower.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>REAR VIEW MIRROR: Cohn concerns faded, cautious BOC on hold, Fedspeak continues to tilt hawkish.</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>TOMORROW: Tariff details/sign-off, ECB/Draghi, BOC Lane.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>KEY THEMES:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COHN CONCERNS/TRADE WARS: </strong>The Cohn concerns have been faded, and many of the opening gaps lower seen in wake of his resignation have been closed. Some traders said that Cohn&rsquo;s waning influence was known for some time, and the Trump administration was always tilting towards a more activist form of nationalistic protectionism. The focus now moves onto when Trump will announce the implementation of tariffs, and most importantly, any details regarding potential carve-outs or exemptions (the White House did note that there may be exemptions for Mexico and Canada on the basis of national security, and exemptions will be decided on a case by case basis). We can expect more details to follow on Thursday and/or Friday. Additionally, there is interest regarding who will be picked to replace Cohn; today, Peter Navarro (Trump advisor who favours nationalist protectionism) said he wasn&rsquo;t in consideration, leaving markets to speculate that Larry Kudlow (commentator, economist) is among the front-runners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS CHINA EDITION: </strong>US President Trump said he had asked China to produce a plan for how to reduce its surplus with the US by $1b. January&rsquo;s data showed the US trade deficit with China had risen to the highest since September 2015, hinting that the America First approach of Donald Trump was yet to yield a meaningful rebalancing in trade dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOC: </strong>Held rates, as analysts had forecasts, though the tone of the central bank was cautious, noting that trade developments are a growing source of uncertainty. Analysts noted that BOC doesn&rsquo;t sound in a hurry to hike rates. However, the last paragraph of the statement was kept unchanged, saying that the BOC will be cautious in normalisation, though higher rates are warranted over time. Analysts at Goldman Sachs still expect the BOC to lift rates on four occasions in 2018 as the economy continues to operate near potential and inflationary pressures are &ldquo;clearly&rdquo; rising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FEDSPEAK: </strong>Fed speakers over the course of the last week have tilted in a hawkish direction. Last week NY Fed&rsquo;s Dudley (NY permanent voter) said four hikes is consistent with &lsquo;gradual&rsquo; normalisation. Overnight, Fed&rsquo;s Brainard (voter) said she had greater confidence inflation was rising towards target, and gradual hikes would be appropriate. Although she applied the usual caveats, it was notable since Brainard has been considered a dove. And another perceived dove &ndash; Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (voter) &ndash; today said he now expects three hikes this year (previously, he was pencilling in just two). The upshot is that there is now a heightened expectation that the Fed&rsquo;s dots may be revised upwards when it meets in a fortnight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX -0.05% at 2727, DJI -0.33% at 24,802, IXIC +0.34% at 7397.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The sharp losses witnessed overnight after US futures reopened were largely retraced in US trade, as concerns about Gary Cohn&rsquo;s departure from the White House were faded. While any tariffs would likely weigh on companies that use steel and aluminium in its production cycle, analysts have argued that the impact will likely be manageable, on the whole. Perhaps part of the reason that equities pared back may have been Peter Navarro (Trump advisor, protectionist) suggesting that he was not a candidate to replace Cohn. And in late trade, stocks were given a boost after the White House said Canada and Mexico may get carve-outs, signalling that Trump may not pursue the most aggressive form of tariff implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* Sectors: </strong>CONS DISC (XLY): -0.74%, CONS STAP (XLP): -0.90%, ENERGY (XLE): -0.83%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -0.19%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): +0.50%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -0.02%, MATERIALS (XLB): -0.43%, TECH (XLK): +0.50%, TELECOMS (XTL): +0.00%, UTILITIES (XLU): -0.71%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle USD 1.45 lower at USD 61.15; Brent futures settle down USD 1.45 at USD 64.35.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INVENTORIES: </strong>Weekly DOE data were not as bearish as the API data had signalled, building less than expected. Cushing stocks drawn down in line with Genscape&rsquo;s weekly forecast. Products drew down, though less than expected. Crude production, meanwhile, rose to a fresh record high. In wake of the data, crude staged a small rally, but after rising to 62.50-60, traders sold into the strength, sending crude to lows near 60.50; traders are citing the broader narrative (rising US production showing few signs of abating; EIA this week forecast a fall in demand while also projecting US output to continue rising) as a reason that crude cannot extend its rally to test the $70 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* REFINERIES: </strong>Elsewhere, Motiva started its crude distillation unit at Port Artur, while Libya&rsquo;s 70k El Feel oilfield is set resume production on Thursday, after a deal was reached to reopen. Colonial shut down its Line 3 following an earlier reported leak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME: US 10-YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES SETTLE 1 TICK LOWER AT 120-20+.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* Treasuries are flat, trading sideways for most of the session. There was some selling pressure in late US trade after the US said there may be exemptions from tariffs, that would likely be detailed on Thursday or Friday. On the whole, however, the TPLEX weathered the &lsquo;Cohn concerns&rsquo; in a ore resilient manner. Tomorrow, the Treasury announces auction sizes for next week&rsquo;s 3s/10s/30s auctions (exp $62b). Yields little changed (+/- 1bps), while major curve spreads were also little changed (+/- 1bps).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY -0.04% HEADING INTO APAC TRADE.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The DXY rose from lows of 89.40 printed in the aftermath of Cohn&rsquo;s resignation, with the positive sentiment being underscore by the potential for carveouts for some countries (details due tomorrow), as well as Peter Navarro (protectionist Trump advisor) seemingly not a candidate to replace Cohn. However, some remain cautious ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s likely singing-off of tariffs by Trump (1700 GMT), and although analysts argue that any impact of the steel/aluminium tariffs are likely manageable, they will likely continue to signal the Trump administrations protectionist view, which has the potential to structurally weaken the dollar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>It has been a roller-coaster of a day for CAD. Overnight, the Loonie slipped to 1.2875 (versus highs over 1.30 on Tuesday); before the BOC meeting, the USDCAD was slightly above 1.29, though spiked higher in a knee-jerk reaction, before retracing; when the White House said the Canadians may &nbsp;&nbsp;get a carve-out, the CAD strengthened, with USDCAD falling to the 1.29 handle once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* The <strong>EUR </strong>held gains above 1.24, but action was muted ahead of the ECB tomorrow, while the <strong>JPY </strong>has made its way back up to the 106.00 handle heading into APAC trade.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Another net down day for the DXY, albeit within a very confined range (89.650-40), and with potentially deeper losses stemmed by much stronger than expected ADP data (headline number and upward revision to back month that was already a big beat vs consensus) and more signs of rising labour costs. However, the widest trade deficit in around a decade merely underscored the whole US import tariff issue and President Trump&rsquo;s incentive to press ahead with plans to impose heavy levies on steel and aluminium. Hence, broad risk sentiment remains fragile if not outright negative and the Greenback traded mostly lower vs G10 safe-havens, bar the Chf for no apparent (fundamental) reason. Usd/Jpy briefly dipped below 105.50 amidst the height of aversion, but not convincingly threatening 2018 lows (105.25) or indeed by the time decent 1.7 bn option expiries rolled off. Eur/Usd tried to advance from a 1.2400 base towards 1.2450 with the aid of an upside break in Eur/Gbp through 0.8950 to a fresh ytd peak around 0.8965, but the headline pair faded before Fib resistance around 1.2461. Usd/Cad saw quite a bit of volatility within a 1.2875-1.2980 range, with the Loonie firming and outperforming its US counterpart after a narrower than forecast Canadian trade gap, but then reversing relative gains and a bit more in wake of a cautious BoC policy statement (trade developments important and growing source of uncertainty). Note, however, the cumulative price movement in Usd/Cad paled vs option risk pricing suggesting 100+ pips in either direction. On that note, break-even indications for Thursday&rsquo;s ECB meeting are circa 67 pips, which could be conservative depending on whether guidance is perceived more hawkish or dovish, and of course the tone of the press conference/Q&amp;A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

(NYT)</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Asian stocks and to a lesser extent their EU counterparts, were seen lower on the news as fears continue to mount over &lsquo;trade-wars&rsquo;</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Looking ahead, highlights include US ADP, BoC rate decision, DoEs, Fed&rsquo;s Bostic, and Dudley</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ASIA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Asian stocks were mostly lower as US political discord took the limelight once again after reports that National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is to resign amid tariff disagreements</strong>. This latest high-profile and &lsquo;market-friendly&rsquo; White House departure dampened the risk appetite and weighed on US equity futures in which Emini S&amp;P gapped lower by about 1% and DJIA futures saw losses of nearly 400 points. <strong>ASX 200 (-1.0%)</strong> underperformed with sentiment also dragged by weaker than expected GDP figures, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.8%)</strong> was choppy and briefly found reprieve, before a firmer JPY ultimately weighed. Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) </strong>and<strong> Hang Seng (-1.0%)</strong> initially outperformed despite reports US may consider broad curbs on Chinese imports and takeovers, as well as news that &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Peter Navarro was among the top 2 candidates to replace Cohn as Trump&rsquo;s top economic adviser. However, gains in Chinese money market rates eventually proved to be the deciding factor and tipped bourses into the red. Finally, 10yr JGBs pared the opening safe-haven inflows to return flat, amid a similar indecisive risk tone in Japanese stocks and following an unchanged BoJ Rinban purchase announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations, but later announced CNY 105.5bln 1yr MLF operation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3294 (Prev. 6.3386)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is said to consider tariffs and reciprocity with China related investment, while measures reportedly may involve broad curbs on Chinese imports and takeovers.

(NYT)</strong> There were also reports that a US administration official stated White House adviser Peter Navarro and commentator Larry Kudlow are the top 2 candidates to replace Gary Cohn, while US President Trump cancelled the tariff meeting on Thursday that Cohn organized. (Newswires) Reports also suggest that Cohn could return to the White House at a later date for an even larger role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Brainard (voter, dove) </strong>said gradual US rate hikes are likely appropriate and that there is greater confidence inflation will reach target, while she added that she is encouraged by substantial fiscal stimulus, full employment and above-trend economic growth. Brainard also stated that headwinds are turning into tailwinds, although they are ready to slow or speed up pace of hikes if forecasts are incorrect. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, soft hawk)</strong> reiterated that baseline scenario is for 3 rate hikes in 2018 and said that it is too early to change forecasts due to tariffs as it is not yet known what will be implemented. Kaplan added that anything that jeopardizes trade relations with Mexico or Canada is not in US interest.

Asia-Pacific stocks reacted with a decline across the board. European cash open <strong>(Eurostoxx 50 -0.1%)</strong> took the lead from Asia with most major bourses in the red, albeit losses have been pared throughout the session. <strong>FTSE 100 (+0.1%) </strong>outperforming, supported by a weaker sterling. The materials sector is underperforming, pressured by the fall in commodity prices fuelled by US API crude stocks printing a build more than twice as expected. <strong>Rolls-Royce (+12.8%)</strong> outperforming on the back of strong earnings. <strong>Smurfit Kappa (+3.3%)</strong> after US based International Papers confirmed its EUR 8bln offer to the company which was then rejected as an &ldquo;opportunistic&rdquo; takeover bid. <strong>Telecom Italia (-0.2%)</strong> is trading in a choppy fashion after company CEO stated the joint venture with Vivendi&rsquo;s Canal+ will be put on hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Jpy</strong>, and <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Chf</strong> to a lesser extent, continues to provide the clearest if not best barometer of broad risk sentiment and the headline pair&rsquo;s latest retreat from 106.00+ levels highlights the resurgence of aversion prompted by the US President&rsquo;s import tariff plans. The failure to extend gains on conciliatory gestures from North Korea on the nuclear front to and beyond a key upside Fib just ahead of 106.50 is deemed to be bearish in terms of the technical outlook, while the departure of chief White House economic adviser Cohn is widely perceived as negative from the global trade wars perspective given his more temperate approach towards protectionist policies. 105.50 bids/support now being tested again, and the 2018 low around 105.25 is back on the radar ahead of reportedly big barriers at 105.00. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Chf</strong> is sitting roughly in the middle of 0.9400-0.9350 parameters, and the pseudo safe-haven <strong>Eur</strong> is looking to climb further above 1.2400 vs the Greenback, while eclipsing its previous ytd base against the still Brexit-weighted <strong>Gbp</strong> to circa 0.8965 (having breached 0.8950 resistance more convincingly). Back to G10 majors, and it&rsquo;s all change again for the commodity bloc that has reversed gains vs their US Dollar counterpart. <strong>Usd</strong>/<strong>Cad</strong> has rebounded over 1.2900 with the <strong>Loonie</strong> underperforming on the tariff proposals and NAFTA ahead of the BoC policy meeting, which is now even more likely to underscore the need for caution. <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> is pivoting around 0.7800 after mixed Aussie GDP data overnight and <strong>Nzd</strong>/<strong>Usd</strong> is back below 0.7300 as the <strong>Aud</strong>/<strong>Nzd</strong> cross holds above 1.0700 in wake of the latest GDT auction showing a dip in prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bunds</strong> marginally erased more gains and inched closer to plugging a hole down to 156.50 at a fresh 156.59 Eurex base (+2 ticks vs +31 ticks at one stage), but <strong>Gilts</strong> have seen better price action in recent trade with an advance to 121.27 (+22 ticks). Not much in the way of fresh catalysts for core fixed, but again it seems that UK rates are moving inversely with Sterling in the FX markets, like the FTSE. Perhaps German debt was displaying some caution just ahead of the bidding deadline for Bobl supply (well received), while resistance a few ticks below 157.00 also continues to cap advances. <strong>US Treasuries</strong> relatively side-lined before a pretty packed pm agenda and ADP&rsquo;s jobs proxy for NFP on Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures are trading with losses of over 1% this morning, largely following last nights API report which showed a wider than expected build in crude inventories (5.7mln vs. Exp. 2.7mln). As such, <strong>WTI</strong> initially traded south of the USD 62/bbl level, with <strong>Brent</strong> briefly below USD 65/bbl before reclaiming the levels. Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> has been trading relatively sideways throughout the morning, having pared its gap higher overnight after initial support from reports of Cohn&rsquo;s resignation.

The failure to extend gains on conciliatory gestures from North Korea on the nuclear front to and beyond a key upside Fib just ahead of 106.50 is deemed to be bearish in terms of the technical outlook, while the departure of chief White House economic adviser Cohn is widely perceived as negative from the global trade wars perspective given his more temperate approach towards protectionist policies. 105.50 bids/support now being tested again, and the 2018 low around 105.25 is back on the radar ahead of reportedly big barriers at 105.00. Usd/Chf is sitting roughly in the middle of 0.9400-0.9350 parameters, and the pseudo safe-haven Eur is looking to climb further above 1.2400 vs the Greenback, while eclipsing its previous ytd base against the still Brexit-weighted Gbp to circa 0.8965 (having breached 0.8950 resistance more convincingly). Back to G10 majors, and it&rsquo;s all change again for the commodity bloc that has reversed gains vs their US Dollar counterpart. Usd/Cad has rebounded over 1.2900 with the Loonie underperforming on the tariff proposals and NAFTA ahead of the BoC policy meeting, which is now even more likely to underscore the need for caution. Aud/Usd is pivoting around 0.7800 after mixed Aussie GDP data overnight and Nzd/Usd is back below 0.7300 as the Aud/Nzd cross holds above 1.0700 in wake of the latest GDT auction showing a dip in prices. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",

On the curve especially the 5yr has seen a strong cheapening since the end of last year. The sector had started to recoup some ground going into the Italian elections and also on the back of trade war fears sparked by Trump. If the ECB tomorrow indeed were to refrain from adjusting the forward guidance while signalling more caution, 5yr German paper stands a chance for a further breather.

This latest high-profile and &lsquo;market-friendly&rsquo; White House departure dampened the risk appetite and weighed on US equity futures in which Emini S&amp;P gapped lower by about 1% and DJIA futures saw losses of nearly 400 points. <strong>ASX 200 (-1.0%)</strong> underperformed with sentiment also dragged by weaker than expected GDP figures, while <strong>Nikkei 225 (-0.9%)</strong> was choppy and briefly found reprieve, before a firmer JPY ultimately weighed. Elsewhere, <strong>Shanghai Comp.

However, gains in Chinese money market rates eventually proved to be the deciding factor and tipped bourses into the red. Finally, 10yr JGBs pared the opening safe-haven inflows to return flat, amid a similar indecisive risk tone in Japanese stocks and following an unchanged BoJ Rinban purchase announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations, but later announced CNY 105.5bln 1yr MLF operation. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3294 (Prev. 6.3386)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US is said to consider tariffs and reciprocity with China related investment, while measures reportedly may involve broad curbs on Chinese imports and takeovers. (Newswires)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Chancellor Hammond said it is in both UK and EU interests to include financial services in the Brexit deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU said UK PM May speech is &#39;double cherry-picking&#39; on Brexit and &lsquo;zero progress&rsquo; has been made on ideas for customs cooperation, according to a document obtained by the Guardian. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK lawmakers suggest that Britain&rsquo;s trade with 70 other nations risks falling off a &lsquo;cliff edge&rsquo; unless May&rsquo;s government can mirror the EU&rsquo;s commerce agreements. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>France&#39;s Finance Minister Le Maire stated that France&#39;s reportedly tough stance on Brexit is &quot;not correct&quot;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Silvio Berlusconi has stated that his centre-right coalition government should be given the right to govern and he should coordinate the process.

The announcement also weighed significantly on <strong>CAD</strong> and MXN as it effectively meant less opposition for the trade protectionists in Washington, with trade skeptic White House adviser Navarro also seen among the front runners to replace Cohn. Elsewhere, <strong>USD</strong> was lacklustre amid the latest political developments and <strong>AUD</strong> weakened following a miss on Q4 GDP, although losses were contained as the data also included upward revisions to prior quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian GDP (Q4) Q/Q 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.5% (Prev. 0.6%, Rev. 0.7%).

Elsewhere, <strong>gold</strong> was initially underpinned at the reopen of futures trade as participants reacted to the Cohn resignation, although the precious metal suffered fatigue from recent advances and gradually returned flat, while <strong>copper</strong> was kept restrained by the risk-averse tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API Crude Stocks (Mar 2) 5.661M vs. Exp. 2.700M (Prev. 0.933M). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC Secretary General Barkindo said demand will hit 100mln barrels per day, faster than any forecasts expected. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAE Energy Minister said both OPEC &amp; NON-OPEC members still have work to do to rebalance the market.

Major curves flattened modestly. The TPLEX saw selling action in early trade as the risk tone improved following positive geopolitical developments from the Korean peninsula. US 10-Year T-Note settled half-a-tick higher at 120-21+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>White House Economic Adviser Gary Cohn is to resign and is expected to leave in next few weeks.</strong> (NYT) There were also reports that a US administration official stated White House adviser Peter Navarro and commentator Larry Kudlow are the top 2 candidates to replace Gary Cohn, while US President Trump cancelled the tariff meeting on Thursday that Cohn organized. (Newswires) Reports also suggest that Cohn could return to the White House at a later date for an even larger role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump administration is said to push for conservative targets related to the Affordable Care Act. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Brainard (voter, dove)</strong> said gradual US rate hikes are likely appropriate and that there is greater confidence inflation will reach target, while she added that she is encouraged by substantial fiscal stimulus, full employment and above-trend economic growth. Brainard also stated that headwinds are turning into tailwinds, although they are ready to slow or speed up pace of hikes if forecasts are incorrect. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter, soft hawk)</strong> reiterated that baseline scenario is for 3 rate hikes in 2018 and said that it is too early to change forecasts due to tariffs as it is not yet known what will be implemented. Kaplan added that anything that jeopardizes trade relations with Mexico or Canada is not in US interest.

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are mostly lower as US political discord takes the limelight once again after reports that National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is to resign amid tariff disagreements. This latest high-profile White House departure dampened the risk appetite and weighed on US equity futures in which DJIA futures saw losses of over 300 points, although Asia bourses have shown some resilience and are off worse levels. ASX 200 (-0.9%) underperforms with sentiment dampened by weaker than expected GDP figures, while Nikkei 225 (-0.2%) is choppy and briefly found reprieve after USD/JPY recovered off lows. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+0.4%) and Hang Seng (+0.1%) are positive as the mainland ignores the possibility US may consider broad curbs on Chinese imports and takeovers, as well as reports that White House adviser and &lsquo;China hawk&rsquo; Peter Navarro is among the top 2 candidates to replace Cohn&nbsp;as Trump&rsquo;s top economic adviser. In addition, Chinese blue-chip banking names are among the biggest gainers after regulators confirmed lowering the bad loan coverage requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY strengthened on safe-haven flows following the announcement of Cohn&rsquo;s resignation, which also weighed significantly on CAD and MXN as it effectively meant less opposition for the trade protectionists in Washington. Elsewhere, USD is lacklustre amid the latest political developments and AUD weakened following a miss on Q4 GDP, although losses were contained as the data also included upward revisions to prior quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs pared the opening safe-haven inflows to return flat, amid a similar indecisive risk tone in Japanese stocks and following an unchanged BoJ Rinban purchase announcement.</p>\r\n",
