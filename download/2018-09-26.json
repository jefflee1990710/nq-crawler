        "content": "<p>27th September 2018<br /><br />FOMC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FOMC hiked rates by 25bps to 2.00%-2.25% as expected via unanimous decision. The Fed removed the reference in its statement that policy is &#39;accommodative&#39;, while it stated it sees gradual hikes and that risks to the economy &#39;roughly balanced&#39;. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement was little changed and the dot plot showed rate hike projections were also unchanged from June, although the Fed&#39;s new 2021 dot estimated rates are to be between 3.25-3.50% which matches its 2020 projection. This hints that the FOMC has put an end date to its hiking cycle and suggests the FOMC does not intend to raise rates above its estimate of neutral (neutral rate estimates are between 2.50-3.50%). Furthermore, core PCE inflations were unchanged across the board, while real GDP forecasts were raised for this year and next year to 3.1% (Prev. 2.8%) and 2.5% (Prev. 2.4%) respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the press conference Powell noted dropping the &#39;accommodative&#39; language is a sign that monetary policy is proceeding in line with expectations and does not signal rate path change. He also sees positive signs of a strong economy and that growth outlook remains favourable with fiscal stimulus boosting the economy; says gradual normalisation helping to sustain US economy. Furthermore, Powell noted that if inflation surprises to the upside, the Fed would have to move quicker but stressed he did not see that happening while he also added trade was a downside risk, though the effects of trade tensions have been relatively small so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a mixed reaction to the FOMC which was initially perceived as dovish due to the dot plots which suggested no more hikes after 2020 and that the Fed will refrain from going above the neutral rate. However, the dollar then found support and stocks were pressured on Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s comments on the economy at the press conference which sounded upbeat about economic prospects and defined this as a particularly bright moment for the US economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ Cash Rate (Sep) 1.75% vs. Exp. 1.75% (Prev. 1.75%). The RBNZ reiterated it expects to keep OCR at this level into 2020 and that next move could be up or down, while it sees early signs of an increase in core inflation and that the outlook for OCR assumes growth will pick up over the coming year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said US is &quot;winning big&quot; in trade dispute with China, while he added there is plenty of evidence of China meddling in upcoming US election and they can&#39;t get involved. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s Cabinet said they will cut import tariffs for some products as of November, this is expected to lower costs of consumers and companies by about CNH 60bln this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US and Japan trade talks are expected to keep auto tariffs on hold initially.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian Economy Minister Tria said that the citizens income will be in the budget alongside tax cuts for businesses in 2019 and income tax cuts in the following years, while he added that the first objective of the budget is to avoid the tax burden from rising and avoiding VAT and excise duty increases.

Alexion (ALXN) was a top performer on the SPX after announcing the acquisition of Syntimmune. SCANA (SCG) was a top performer with unusual option activity cited. Incyte (INCY) was buoyed on an initiation at Leerink. Nielsen (NLSN) was higher after Blackstone (BX) and Carlyle Group (CG) expressed interest in the co. Viacom (VIAB) also posted gains after reports that talks may resume CBS (CBS) talks next year. Cintas (CTAS) lagged despite topping Q1 earnings, Lam Research (LCRX) was also down on a UBS downgrade. KB Homes (KBH) was lower despite decent earnings AMC on Thursday, as it tracked other homebuilders lower. Papa John&#39;s (PZZA) spiked on news it was reaching out to private equity names to buy the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex was choppy around settlement, given the FOMC&rsquo;s decision to lift rates, and amid the press conference with Chair Powell, who was generally upbeat, but cognizant of risks. Informa points out that ahead of the Fed chair&rsquo;s press conference, Treasuries were bear-steepening, led by the belly, but sellers stepped in with block sales in TYZ8. Choppy trade continued through the end of Powell&rsquo;s presser, which ultimately saw major curve spreads flattening, with 2s10s narrowing beneath its 50DMA, and 2s30s and 5s30s and 5s10s were capped by their 50DMAs. The FOMC rate decision has set the tone for Thursday&rsquo;s 7-year auction, with analysts noting that the recent sell-off of Treasuries has lifted the 7s yield to above 3%, making the WI yield cheaper compared to the previous stop-out rate, which analysts say could provide support. In addition, Societe Generale says that any short-covering from the record net shorts from leveraged funds in the TY futures could also provide support, while the auction may also benefit from month-end extensions. The 7-year has also cheapened on the fly over the last fortnight vs 5s and 10s, which could be a positive. SocGen holds a slightly positive bias going into the auction. US T-note futures (Z8) settle&nbsp; 9 ticks higher at 118-23+.</p>\r\n",

REAR-VIEW: FOMC hikes rates by 25bps as expected; China to cut some import tariffs; new home sales beat; on-going budget talks in Italy; Trump told Canada&rsquo;s Trudeau no need to worry about tariffs if NAFTA deal. AHEAD: RBNZ rate decision AFMC; US GDP Final Reading; US 7yr notes auction; Italian Budget Economic and Financial Document release; German State and National CPI&#39;s; Fed&#39;s Powell &amp; Kaplan, BoE&#39;s Carney &amp; Haldane, and ECB&#39;s Draghi &amp; Praet to speak.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOMC: </strong>FOMC hikes rates by 25bps, as expected, and removed the reference in its statement that policy is &#39;accommodative&#39;. Forecasts were little changed. The dovish reaction to the rate decision and forecasts is likely a result of the fact that the Fed&#39;s new 2021 dot looks for rates to be between 3.25-3.50%, matching its 2020 projection, and thus hinting that the FOMC has put an end date to its hiking cycle. Additionally, it appears that the FOMC does not intend to raise rates above its estimate of neutral (neutral rate estimates are between 2.50-3.50%). At his press conference Powell sounded upbeat about economic prospect, defining this as a particularly bright moment for the US economy; the market&rsquo;s reaction during the press conference was generally slightly more hawkish. Powell noted dropping the &#39;accommodative&#39; language is a sign that monetary policy is proceeding in line with expectations, and does not signal rate path change. He however noted that if inflation surprises to the upside, the Fed would have to move quicker, but stressed he did not see that happening; similarly, a slowing down in the economy or in the financial conditions will be something the Fed would react to. Powell said trade was a downside risk, though the effects of trade tensions have been relatively small so far; on trade tensions, he referred us back to the recent Beige Book which contained many references to difficulties on the back of trade relations. In terms of the inflationary impact, Powell said tariffs might provide a basis to companies to raise prices, while noting the uncertainty that trade still represents. On the neutral rate, he is not expecting a dramatic recovery in the long-term. On the pace of rate hikes, Powell generally endorsed the gradual approach, and noted that some participants saw a moderate overshoot of neutral rate. On the central bank&rsquo;s independence, he claimed the Fed does not consider political factors when deciding policy as it focuses on the mandate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE:</strong> China&#39;s Cabinet said it will cut import tariffs for some products from November, which is expected to lower costs of consumers and companies by about CNH 60bln this year. The Cabinet noted customs tariffs are to be cut from 9.8% to 7.5%. The US set to announce a framework for Japanese trade talks today, as according to sources, with focus on autos. On NAFTA, Canadian PM Trudeau said Trump has told him there will be no need to worry about tariffs if a new NAFTA deal is agreed, but it is possible a trilateral NAFTA may not happen; adding US tariffs need to be scrapped for Canada to feel confident about a new trade agreement. He also claimed they will take as long as necessary to negotiate a new NAFTA deal. Sources later reported the text of the US-Mexico trade deal is expected to be released on Friday, noting the deal has been written to allow Canada to join later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT:</strong> EU Chief Negotiator Barnier said we have had a good meeting today with the EESC President working for an orderly Brexit and a new partnership that respects the UK&#39;s sovereignty as well as EU&#39;s principles, including the single market. Elsewhere, Labour Leader Corbyn said he will back any deal brought back by PM May that includes a customs union, no hard Irish border, protects jobs, rights and standards. Elsewhere, the Irish Finance Minister thinks the Irish economy would grow at a significant lower rate next year in an event of a no-deal Brexit. In other news, the UK Autumn Budget will take place on 29 October, UK Chancellor Hammond confirmed. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>The ECB said its model signals that a 10% tariff on all US imports and equivalent retaliation from other nations would lead to the US bearing the brunt, and China potentially better off by retaliating. ECB&#39;s Praet said that growth risks are mounting, but these growth risks are not impacting data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY: </strong>Budget talks continued over in Italy ahead of the 27th September official deadline for next year&rsquo;s plan. Italian Deputy Prime Minister Di Maio Wednesday said he wants a 2019 deficit between 2.4-2.5%, noting that the 2% deficit/GDP ratio is not a taboo, they will keep responsible and keep an eye on markets. Italian Economy Minister said that the first objective of the budget is to avoid the tax burden from rising and avoiding VAT and excise duty increases; adding the aim is to reduce the growth gap by half with the rest of the EU during the first year of government. He confirmed the citizens income will be in the budget alongside tax cuts for businesses in 2019 and income tax cuts in the following years. There were rumour from Corriere that Italy&rsquo;s budget showed a 2.4% deficit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US President Trump Wednesday said he is willing to meet with Venezuela&#39;s Maduro, adding that every option is still on the table. Elsewhere, US Secretary of State Pompeo said the meeting with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri was &lsquo;very positive&rsquo;. Iran&#39;s Rouhani stated Iran will remain in 2015 nuclear deal as long as it serves its interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NEW HOME SALES </strong>rose by 3.5% in August, expectations were for a 0.5% increase, and posted at 629k higher than the downwardly revised 608k in July and mostly in line with consensus. Sales continue to increase but the pace has slowed to 0.8% y/y in the last 6 months, the lowest since 2012, analysts at Pantheon note. In terms of outlook, they expect little change to sales but note recent mortgage data imply a slight increase this autumn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX down 0.33% at 2906, NDX flat at 7563, DJI down 0.40% at 26385. SECTORS:</strong> Energy -0.99%, Materials -1.03%, Industrials -0.15%, Cons Discretionary +0.20%, Cons Staples +0.06%, Healthcare +0.20%, Financials -1.27%, Tech -0.41%, Telecoms +0.36%, Utilities -1.04%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Nike (NKE) was at the foot of the Dow after earnings on Tuesday evening disappointed, whilst IBM (IBM) led the index following an upgrade at UBS. Alexion (ALXN) was a top performer on the SPX after announcing the acquisition of Syntimmune. SCANA (SCG) was a top performer with unusual option activity cited. Incyte (INCY) was buoyed on an initiation at Leerink. Nielsen (NLSN) was higher after Blackstone (BX) and Carlyle Group (CG) expressed interest in the co. Viacom (VIAB) also posted gains after reports that talks may resume CBS (CBS) talks next year. Cintas (CTAS) lagged despite topping Q1 earnings, Lam Research (LCRX) was also down on a UBS downgrade. KB Homes (KBH) was lower despite decent earnings AMC on Thursday, as it tracked other homebuilders lower. Papa John&#39;s (PZZA) spiked on news it was reaching out to private equity names to buy the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES USD 0.71 LOWER AT USD 71.57/BBL, BRENT (X8) SETTLES USD 0.53 LOWER AT USD 81.34/BBL.</strong> Weekly inventory data from the DOE showed crude stocks building by 1.9mln barrels, Cushing stocks up 500k, gasoline build of 1.5mln, while distillate stocks drew 2.2mln bbls, with crude markets reacting bearishly as the official DOE data confirm the surprise build reported by the API on Tuesday. There were reports that traders were taking profits after a solid run for oil. On the broker front, analysts at Goldman Sachs see Brent prices stabilising between $70-80 through the rest of this year. On the geopolitical front, Iran&rsquo;s oil minister, responding to Trump&rsquo;s criticism of OPEC, stated that if Trump wanted lower oil prices, he should stop interfering in the Middle East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE &nbsp;9 TICKS HIGHER AT 118-23+.</strong> The Treasury complex was choppy around settlement, given the FOMC&rsquo;s decision to lift rates, and amid the press conference with Chair Powell, who was generally upbeat, but cognizant of risks. Informa points out that ahead of the Fed chair&rsquo;s press conference, Treasuries were bear-steepening, led by the belly, but sellers stepped in with block sales in TYZ8. Choppy trade continued through the end of Powell&rsquo;s presser, which ultimately saw major curve spreads flattening, with 2s10s narrowing beneath its 50DMA, and 2s30s and 5s30s and 5s10s were capped by their 50DMAs. The FOMC rate decision has set the tone for Thursday&rsquo;s 7-year auction, with analysts noting that the recent sell-off of Treasuries has lifted the 7s yield to above 3%, making the WI yield cheaper compared to the previous stop-out rate, which analysts say could provide support. In addition, Societe Generale says that any short-covering from the record net shorts from leveraged funds in the TY futures could also provide support, while the auction may also benefit from month-end extensions. The 7-year has also cheapened on the fly over the last fortnight vs 5s and 10s, which could be a positive. SocGen holds a slightly positive bias going into the auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP - RBNZ RATE DECISION DUE AT 2200BST/1600CDT/0500HKT ON 26 SEPTEMBER 2018.</strong> RBNZ expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.75%. Expectations for the latest RBNZ rate decision are one-sided for a continued pause with all analysts surveyed forecasting the central bank to maintain the Official Cash Rate at 1.75% where it has been since September 2016. In addition, the central bank is also expected reiterate its view for rates staying expansionary for a considerable period and that the next move could either be a hike or cut. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20160/download\">Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</a></p>\r\n",

However, the tone of the accompanying statement, SEP and dot plots will determine whether this is merely hedging for a hawkish outcome and short covering or another dead cat bounce. The DXY is nudging 94.400 vs just over 94.000 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franc has emerged as the clear G10 underperformer over the course of Wednesday&rsquo;s EU session, and a downbeat Swiss ZEW survey may have contributed belatedly, although Usd/Chf&rsquo;s climb towards 0.9700 could be more on the SNB vs Fed policy divergence angle, while Eur/Chf extending its rebound above 1.1350 came after more assurances from the Italian Government over the 2019 budget and trying to keep the deficit in check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major currency to succumb to increased selling pressure and retreating further from recent peaks against the Greenback, but not quite far enough to trigger heavy option expiries from 1.1725-35 (2 bn) having been capped ahead of a key Fib at the opposite end of the range. Note, the Eur also lost ground vs the NOK and SEK on the ECB against Scandi Central Bank outlook at least in part.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both moderately softer vs the Usd, with the Loonie slipping below 1.2950 amidst more NAFTA headlines suggesting that a deal remains elusive, while the Pound faced yet more Brexit commentary that veered from positive to negative on prospects for a deal. Cable did bounce just a head of tech support around 1.3136 (Fib level) and held above 1.3150 for the most part, but failed to retest 1.3200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All relatively resilient, with the Jpy managing to withstand bearish end of September/Q3/Japanese half year end bank rebalancing signals and another pretty severe test of bids/stops around 113.00 vs the Usd and decent option expiries from 112.95-113.00, while the Aud kept in contact with the 0.7250 level and a 1.1 bn expiry between there and 0.7255. The Kiwi derived support from a sharp rebound in NZ business sentiment overnight having baulked at a wider than forecast trade gap earlier, and is now eyeing the Fed before the RBNZ with no change in the OCR anticipated, but the chance of a less dovish tweak to guidance and/or the latest economic assessment &ndash; Nzd/Usd hovering just below 0.6650.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 from the last 3 for the CNB in terms of &frac14; point tightening moves, and options left open for another at November&rsquo;s policy meeting, or early 2019 if not &ndash; Eur/Czk slightly firmer after some choppy moves circa 25.6750. Elsewhere, Try and Zar still outperforming, former post-latest CBRT independence claims via the Finance Minister and latter ahead of SA President Ramaphosa.</p>\r\n",

Gilts have also eased back from Liffe peaks of 120.75 (+29 ticks) alongside USTs, albeit with curves still moderately flatter and talk doing the rounds about some asset-switching in favour of bonds over stocks for Friday (or rather the turn of the month, Q3 and fy H1 for Japan).

Nzd/Usd rebounded towards 0.6700, but is now back down around 0.6650 vs Cable unable to reach 1.3200 and retreating towards 0.8950 again vs the EUR. Note, some bank rebalancing models point to buy signals for the single currency, and SEK, but this is not really evident in Eur/Usd (yet) that remains capped ahead of 1.1800, or Eur/Sek around 10.3700, with mega option expiries in the headline pair in particular perhaps keeping moves in check (1.1755-75 parameters between 1.1725-35 in 2bn, 1.1740-50 in 3.1 bn and 1.1800 in 1.7 bn for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best G10 currencies in terms of gains vs a still soggy Usd (DXY only just holding above 94.000), with the Aud maintaining 0.7250+ status and Jpy defending 113.00 again, even though month/quarter/Japanese half year end positioning is said to be net negative. Expiry interest may also be influential here with some decent layered run-offs from 112.95-113.00 down to 112.30-35 (1-2 bn), and between 0.7250-55 in Aud/Usd (1.1 bn).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marginal laggards as the Loonie continues to pivot 1.2950 amidst the ongoing NAFTA stalemate, but cushioned somewhat by elevated oil prices, while the Franc is anchored around 0.9650 and 1.1350 vs the Eur after a sharp deterioration in ZEW&rsquo;s Swiss investor sentiment index that underscores SNB caution about risks to the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try has taken over the mantle as main regional mover, albeit with the Zar not far behind and both firmer vs the Usd. The Lira appears to be encouraged by more assurances about CBRT independence from Turkey&rsquo;s Finance Minister, while the Rand awaits an address from President Ramaphosa later today. Usd/Try at the lower end of a circa 6.2000-1000 band and Usd/Zar also nearer the base of 14.3800-2750 parameters.</p>\r\n",

Back to Liffe, some minor underperformance at the short end with 3 month contracts flat to 1 tick adrift after trying to nudge above parity with little conviction, but again in line with the Euribor strip and broader curve flattening into the FOMC.

Elsewhere, JPY was choppy in which it initially weakened before USD/JPY stalled around the 113.00 level and DXY remained flat just above the 94.00 level, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD traded little changed amid a lack of fresh catalysts and ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand NBNZ Business Outlook Sep -38.3% (Prev. -50.3%) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand NBNZ Own Activity Sep 7.8% (Prev. 3.8%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Trade Balance Jun -1484.0M vs. Exp. -930.0M (Prev. -143.0M, Rev. -193.0M) (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Trade Balance Jun Y/Y -4.05B vs. Exp. -4.62B (Prev. -4.44B, Rev. -4.50B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Trade - Exports Jun 4.05B vs. Exp. 4.40B (Prev. 5.35B, Rev. 5.34B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Zealand Trade - Imports Jun 5.54B vs. Exp. 5.50B (Prev. 5.49B, Rev. 5.54B)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded mixed as Brent and WTI nursed some of the losses from a surprise build in API crude inventories which led to the former slipping further below the USD 82.00/bbl level. With regards to Iran, there were reports that India is said to cut oil imports from Iran to zero in November (later denied), while Goldman added the initial decline in Iran could bring prices to USD 82.50/bbl and that price risks are skewed to the upside given the elevated geopolitical tensions among oil producers and robust oil demand.

Today&rsquo;s 5yr note auction tailed by 0.4bps; the bid-to-cover came in at 2.997 showing demand was uninspiring and at the lowest since December.

        "content": "<p>Asian equities are mostly higher despite a mixed lead from Wall St. where the Dow and S&amp;P closed with losses amid cautiousness ahead of the FOMC. ASX 200 (+0.1%) trades marginally higher with gains led by the strength in commodity names amid the bounce in base metals, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) underperforms as the index failed to benefit from early currency weakness but remains in close proximity to test the 24,000 level. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.1%) and Shanghai Comp (+.1.1%) outperforms as trade tensions take a backseat amid reports that MSCI will consider increasing the weight of China A-shares in its indices to 20% from 5%, in turn spurring demand for Chinese stocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, antipodeans stole the limelight as an improvement in New Zealand&rsquo;s business outlook and activity lifted NZD/USD to near weekly highs and gave AUD/USD a boost in sympathy, while CAD nurses some of its intra-day losses to trade around 1.2950 against the greenback. Elsewhere, JPY is choppy in which it initially weakened before USD/JPY stalled around the 113.00 level and DXY remains flat just above the 94.00 level, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD trade little changed amid a lack of fresh catalysts and ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs saw a slight rebound and printed fresh weekly highs as yields marginally declined across the curve, with focus shifting to today&rsquo;s 40-year auction.</p>\r\n",
