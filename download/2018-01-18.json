US Senate Majority Leader McConnell, however, is confident the House will pass the bill later on Thursday, though McConnell said he was prepared for a shutdown, Politico reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, Fox News reported that some lawmakers are preparing to remain in Washington over the weekend to resolve any government spending issues, citing Capitol Hill sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill is likely to face opposition from some House Republicans, with the Freedom Caucus&rsquo; leader Meadows suggesting that between 22-25 members of Republican members of the Caucus would vote against the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the GOP is likely to pass the bill in the House, it will need support from Democrats for the Senate vote, which is yet to be scheduled. But with that said, <strong>Politico reported that Senate Democrats say they have votes to block government funding bill</strong>, once again raising the spectre of a government shutdown, while there were also comments from US Sen. Flake who suggested that they are also discussing a 5-day stop-gap spending bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: S&amp;P 500 -0.16% at 2798, DJIA -0.36% at 26021, NDX +0.02% at 6811</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top performers: Tech +0.15%, Telecom +0.14%, Healthcare +0.03%%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bottom performers: Utilities -0.78%, Energy -0.78%, Industrials -0.5%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US stocks were mixed, trading negative in early trade after rising to new record highs this week, though the S&amp;P 500 seemed to be clinging to the 2800 mark, while the Dow Jones was hovering around 26,000. In later trade, however, stock indices were content to look through warnings of a Government shutdown, and the S&amp;P 500 was lifted to fresh highs, before falling again as it emerged that Democrat opposition in the Senate is likely to be a stumbling block, likely leading to a government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telecoms were leading gains, with Viacom an outperformer on merger hopes with CBS. Industrials were lagging, after Boeing &ndash; the best performer on the Dow in 2018 &ndash;&nbsp; after it was reported that Emirates would purchase 36 A380 aircraft from rival Airbus, dragging on the industrials sector. &nbsp;Utilities underperformed and energy stocks tracked early weakness in crude prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES: US 10-Year T-Note Futures settle 6+ ticks lower at 122-14+</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk504069389\">The US Treasury curve bear steepened after China reported solid growth data for Q4, and the steepness was maintained as we entered North American trade. Additionally, news that Apple was set to repatriate a large amount of offshore capital helped keep the risk mood firm.

The dollar was also pressured by political headlines raising the possibility that a stopgap spending bill would not be passed by Friday night, likely leading to a government shutdown. As the session wore on, the 111.00 was reclaimed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cable continues to stalk the 1.39 handle on a mixture of greenback weakness as well as optimism regarding Brexit. Today&rsquo;s focus was on a press conference between UK PM May and her French counterpart. While the two generally avoided direct comments regarding Brexit, the French PM said say that if the UK wants access to the single market, it can choose between the Norway model or full-membership. May, however, said that the UK/EU relationship post-Brexit should cover the services industry, says London will continue to be a major global financial centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR wasn&rsquo;t swayed by further ECB chatter on Thursday, with speakers largely avoiding comments relating to current policy ahead of next week&rsquo;s ECB meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WTI futures settle 2 cents lower at $63.95 per barrel; Brent futures settle 7 cents lower at $69.31 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude pared back losses after weekly inventory data showed crude stocks drawing down by 6.9mln barrels in the latest week, while stocks at the Cushing hub fell by 4.184mln &ndash; the largest weekly fall on record.

US Senate Majority Leader McConnell, however, is confident the House will pass the bill later on Thursday, though McConnell said he was prepared for a shutdown, Politico reported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Separately, Fox News reported that some lawmakers are preparing to remain in Washington over the weekend to resolve any government spending issues, citing Capitol Hill sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bill is likely to face opposition from some House Republicans, with the Freedom Caucus&rsquo; leader Meadows suggesting that between 22-25 members of Republican members of the Caucus would vote against the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the GOP is likely to pass the Bill in the House, it will need support from Democrats for the Senate vote, which is yet to be scheduled.

In later trade, however, stock indices were content to look through warnings of a Government shutdown, and the S&amp;P 500 was lifted to fresh highs, before falling again as it emerged that Democrat opposition in the Senate is likely to be a stumbling block, likely leading to a government shutdown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Telecoms were leading gains, with Viacom an outperformer on merger hopes with CBS.

May, however, said that the UK/EU relationship post-Brexit should cover the services industry, says London will continue to be a major global financial centre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The EUR wasn&rsquo;t swayed by further ECB chatter, with speakers largely avoiding comments relating to current policy ahead of next week&rsquo;s ECB meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI futures settle 2 cents lower at $63.95 per barrel; Brent futures settle 7 cents lower at $69.31 per barrel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crude pared back losses after weekly inventory data showed crude stocks drawing down by 6.9mln barrels in the latest week, while stocks at the Cushing hub fell by 4.184mln &ndash; the largest weekly fall on record.

The Index has slipped back below 90.500 from just above 91.000, and option interest could well have impacted into the NY cut as Usd/Jpy reversed from near 111.50 highs towards and then through 111.00 to a circa 110.90 low, bang in the middle of 110.80 and 111.00 expiries (1.5 bn or thereabout at each strike). Back to Usd/Cad, a 1.2460 expiry may also have influenced direction as the pair squeezed up to 1.2480 from around 1.2430 before easing back. Eur/Usd and Cable climbed steadily after some choppy trade to stand at 1.2250+ and just under 1.3900 respectively, but the Chf, Aud and Nzd all managed to reclaim big figure or round number status as the US Dollar waned again, sub-0.6600 (but not quite as low as yesterday), 0.8000 and 0.7300-plus respectively. Tech-wise, the DXY needs to hold above the 90.100 area to avoid heavier declines, while the fundamental focus switches to EIA crude and product inventories before the House vote on the stop-gap spending bill.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (Unch.) and Nikkei 225 (-0.7%) both gained at the open in which the Japanese benchmark briefly rose above the 24000 level for the first time in around 27 years, although both then pared gains with Japanese stocks sliding into the close, while commodity-related stocks in Australia were dampened by disappointing production updates from Whitehaven Coal and Woodside Petroleum. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.1%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) were varied in anticipation of tier-1 China data releases including GDP in which officials including Premier Li had suggested the economy grew 6.9% for 2017. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat uneventful with early short-covering seen in prices after yields rose to a 6-month high of above 0.08%. Furthermore, mixed 30yr auction results and source reports that some at the BoJ were said to see a need for future normalization talks, failed to garner a reaction, as they also agreed that current stimulus was needed for the time-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day, CNY 70bln via 14-day and CNY 10bln via 63-day reverse repos.

Additionally, optimism over a potential passing of a stop-gap funding bill to prevent a government shutdown also buoyed demand for equities. Elsewhere, encouraging Chinese GDP data helped aid sentiment with China reporting the fastest growth in 2yrs. IT names outperforming in Europe with Infineon shares rising some 4% after a positive note out from Goldman Sachs. FTSE 100 struggling thus with the index dragged down by the likes of Whitbread after a soft earnings report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Usd Index extended recovery gains to just over 91.000 overnight, but quickly backed off again despite supportive impulses via data, rising Treasury yields and another solid Fed Beige Book. The Greenback is now relatively mixed within ranges vs G10 counterparts, around 1.2200 against the Eur, 111.25 vs the Jpy and with Cable back down between 1.3800-50 after a spike to 1.3942 (new peak since the Brexit vote). Back to Usd/Jpy, and some large option expiries could well provide some direction today, with 1.4 bn at the 111.00 strike and 1.5 bn at 110.80, while on the upside there is key chart resistance at 111.74 (200 DMA) and 111.97 (50% Fib). For Eur/Usd, if 1.2200 is breached again on the downside then stops are reportedly seen below 1.2150, while 1.2119 is tech support ahead of the next big figure. Aud and Nzd both firming up again vs their US counterpart towards 0.8000 and 0.7300 after the former traded in a volatile fashion on mixed jobs data. In terms of crosses, Eur/Gbp has seen offers around 0.8830 filled, but bids at 0.8800 and strong chart support around 0.8792 are forming a base.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Employment Change (Dec) 34.7k vs. Exp. 15.0k (Prev. 61.6k, Rev. 63.6k).

Bunds have now been down to 160.32, -1/2 point on the day and just 2 ticks shy of tech support that stands in front of the January low so far at 160.11.

        "content": "<p>European equities inching higher this morning following on from the bounce back seen on Wall Street, which had stemmed from reports that Apple are to pledge a USD 350bln contribution to the US economy. Additionally, optimism over a potential passing of a stop-gap funding bill to prevent a government shutdown also buoyed demand for equities. Elsewhere, encouraging Chinese GDP data helped aid sentiment with China reporting the fastest growth in 2yrs. IT names outperforming in Europe with Infineon shares rising some 4% after a positive note out from Goldman Sachs. FTSE 100 struggling thus with the index dragged down by the likes of Whitbread after a soft earnings report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Usd Index extended recovery gains to just over 91.000 overnight, but quickly backed off again despite supportive impulses via data, rising Treasury yields and another solid Fed Beige Book. The Greenback is now relatively mixed within ranges vs G10 counterparts, around 1.2200 against the Eur, 111.25 vs the Jpy and with Cable back down between 1.3800-50 after a spike to 1.3942 (new peak since the Brexit vote). Back to Usd/Jpy, and some large option expiries could well provide some direction today, with 1.4 bn at the 111.00 strike and 1.5 bn at 110.80, while on the upside there is key chart resistance at 111.74 (200 DMA) and 111.97 (50% Fib). For Eur/Usd, if 1.2200 is breached again on the downside then stops are reportedly seen below 1.2150, while 1.2119 is tech support ahead of the next big figure. Aud and Nzd both firming up again vs their US counterpart towards 0.8000 and 0.7300 after the former traded in a volatile fashion on mixed jobs data. In terms of crosses, Eur/Gbp has seen offers around 0.8830 filled, but bids at 0.8800 and strong chart support around 0.8792 are forming a base.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More downside pressure in the debt markets, and US Treasury led as the 10 year benchmark yield inches another basis point closer to the 2.63-64% area that many chartists and cash traders have been flagging if not targeting. Bunds have now been down to 160.32, -1/2 point on the day and just 2 ticks shy of tech support that stands in front of the January low so far at 160.11. Accordingly, 10 year German yields are within a whisker of 0.6%, albeit on the relatively new 2028 bond, while the UK equivalent is just below 1.35%, future only a few ticks off the 123.56 Liffe base and now looking towards the 2023 DMO tap for further/independent impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures marginally lower despite last nights wider than expected drawdown in the latest API crude report. Price action in oil largely dictated by the mild recovery seen in the USD-index.</p>\r\n",

There is also little micro RV, and all issues have outperformed swaps. Likewise, Spain is still generally looking expensive to Italy on a cross market basis, so there is unlikely to be much switching, unless investors think the spread will widen further if the Italian elections in March cause any political stress. However they still foresee the auctions passing without too much issue as there is little credit negative news in the market at the moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of historical data:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.45% 2022 prev. b/c 2.55 and average yield 0.29%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.35% 2033 prev. b/c 1.78 and average yield 1.184%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.9% 2046 prev. b/c 2.07 and average yield 2.874%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 0930GMT and results are published shortly after</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: French EUR 6.5-7.5bln 0.00% 2021, 0.00% 2023 and 2.25% 2024 Bond Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good outright concession after December/January selloff in EGBs.<br />10-year OATs have been hit particularly hard, but front-end still cheaper to very long-end.<br />First front-end France supply since mid-November.<br />New 2/21 OAT talked +5.5bp over 11/20 OAT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of historical data:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.00% 2021 prev. b/c 5.2 and average yield -0.48%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.00% 2023 prev. b/c 2.27 and average yield -0.13%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.25% 2024 prev. b/c 1.78 and average yield 0.16%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 0950GMT and results are published shortly after</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>AUCTION PREVIEW: UK GBP 2.25bln 0.75% 2023 Gilt Auction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the last tap yields are higher by around 7bp, so there is a modest degree of natural concession built into the tap. The strength of the sale will no doubt focus on the curve where there is around 4bp of relevant value on the mismatched fly between the 1T22s and the 2Q23s. Also bear mind that at this level, the bond will be the cheapest in the 5-year sector of the Gilt curve on an asset swap basis, which is likely to be the case until the stock reaches benchmark size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical Data</p>\r\n\r\n<p>0.75% Jul&rsquo;2023 Prev. b/c 2.1, average yield 0.889% and a tail of 0.3bps</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bids are submitted by 1030GMT and results are published shortly after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>PREVIEW: US to sell USD 13bln in 10-year TIPS on 18 January at 1300 ET/1800 GMT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- US Treasury will auction a new January 2028 TIPS bond, which will likely have a 0.5% coupon, according to analysts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- &ldquo;The new bond is being quoted at +3.25bp in real yield spread vs the current benchmark in the WI indications,&rdquo; Societe Generale writes. &ldquo;This is equivalent to +3.75bp after taking into account the (negative) carry to month-end.&rdquo; The bank says that this would be equivalent to a breakeven of around 2.007% vs the Tsy Nov 2027.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The current 10y benchmark TIP trades at a spot breakeven around 2.04%, the last January benchmark (Jan 2027) trades around 2.01%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- SocGen says that valuation appear fair, and are being supported by the recent gains in energy prices. However, the bank argues that it trades rich on the curve as well as when compared to recent history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- The bank also notes that Q1 tends to be a good quarter for flows into TIPS, due to seasonality. &ldquo;Recent flow into TIPS has been particularly good, as was the case in early 2017. In particular, net flow into ETFs was strong in November, December and the first two weeks of January, averaging close to $1bn. The same has been the case for open-ended TIPS funds, with December seeing the largest net positive flow since the post-US-election months.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- SocGen expects the auction to be well received, arguing that momentum and technicals are supportive factors, while the bank believes that breakevens have further to run, despite being at eh top of the range of the last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In terms of participation, foreign investors have taken down a decent amount of new TIPS. Cover, meanwhile, has tended to be etween 2.3x and 2.6x since the Treasury cut volumes of TIPS.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks trade mostly higher as region rides on the momentum from Wall St. where the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA closed above 2800 and 26000 for the first time ever amid earnings optimism, as well as reports that Apple is to repatriate some of its cash holdings and invest in the US. ASX 200 (+0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) both gained at the open in which the Japanese benchmark briefly rose above the 24000 level for the first time in around 27 years, although both then pulled back from intraday highs with the Australian benchmark nearly flat as commodity related stocks are dampened amid disappointing production updates from Whitehaven Coal and Woodside Petroleum. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.5%) are both positive with all focus on the upcoming key Chinese data releases including GDP in which Premier Li had suggested the economy grew 6.9% for 2017, as well as Industrial Production and Retail Sales data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD firmed during the prior US session after reports that Apple (AAPL) were to pay a USD 38bln tax bill to repatriate funds into the US, which saw EUR/USD slip below 1.2200 and GBP/USD retreat from a fresh post-Brexit high above 1.3900. Elsewhere, the strength in the greenback coupled with safe-haven outflows pushed USD/JPY above 111.00, while AUD/USD saw a knee-jerk reaction on better than expected Australian Employment Change of 34.7K jobs vs. Exp. 15.0K jobs. However, the gains were then pared as the data also included an unexpected increase in the Unemployment Rate and was also likely influenced by seasonal factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with only mild-short covering seen in prices after yields rose to a 6-month high of above 0.08%. Furthermore, participants are side-lined ahead of a 30yr auction later and source reports that some at the BoJ were said to see a need for future normalization talks, failed to garner a reaction as they also agreed that current stimulus is needed for the time-being.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>ASB:</strong> To remain solid on the back of domestic demand and a recovering world economy that is supporting Chinese exports.&nbsp; According to the Xinhua News Agency, Premier Li Keqiang said the Chinese economy expanded by 6.9% in 2017</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barclays: </strong>We expect industrial production growth to remain broadly stable, at 6.1%, in December, as signalled by solid manufacturing PMIs. We forecast fixed asset investment growth will moderate to 7.1% in December, with recovering manufacturing investment partially offsetting an expected slowdown in infrastructure and real estate investment. Growth in retail sales is likely to remain above 10% despite some moderation in auto sales. We view strong exports, robust consumption, and slow but solid investment growth as presenting upside risks to our GDP growth forecast of 6.3% q/q saar (or 6.7% y/y) for Q4 17.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BMO: </strong>Look for fourth quarter China real GDP on Thursday, along with industrial production and retail sales for December. Consensus is calling for broader economic growth to slow from 6.8% in Q3 to 6.7% in Q4, which would mark the smallest gain in just over a year, though, broadly speaking, in line with the average pace over the past three years. Rare is the day when this release surprises consensus. For 2018, officials are targeting growth of &ldquo;around 6.5%&rdquo; (we are a bit higher at 6.6%), with momentum easing as the PBoC slowly lets market forces have a bit more influence on the yuan, allowing it to strengthen further. That process started earlier this month when it stopped using a &ldquo;countercyclical adjustment factor&rdquo; to help calculate the CNY&rsquo;s daily value. The central bank could easily step back in to guide the currency if there is too much volatility, but they are headed in the right direction. China&rsquo;s regulators will also continue to cool lending activity at shadow banks (not a bad thing), which will dampen economic growth as well in 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CBA: </strong>Chinese GDP remains solid because of domestic demand and a recovering world economy supporting Chinese exports.&nbsp; According to Xinhua News Agency, Premier Li Keqiang said the Chinese economy expanded by 6.9% in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HSBC: </strong>We estimate the Chinese economy grew at a slower rate of 6.6% y-o-y in Q4 2017, as tougher environmental regulations and winter season production caps impacted activity. That implies GDP growth of 6.7% for 2017 (unchanged from the pace in 2016). Looking ahead, economic growth is likely to remain resilient, supported by the pick-up in global demand and manufacturing investment, even as the property market slows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Westpac: </strong>China GDP has consistently beaten expectations through 2017, spurred on by external demand as well as a robust pipeline of investment projects that are proceeding to completion. It may again be the case that growth surprises to the upside; however, we and the market believe the more likely outcome is that momentum slows a tick from 6.8%yr to 6.7%yr. The basis of this view is partly attributable to the slowdown in investment currently being seen across the economy, in both residential and non-residential construction as well as other investment spending being undertaken by the government and corporates. Also key to the growth story is the consumer. Here we see robust demand, but not enough of an acceleration to more than offset the softening investment pulse.</p>\r\n",
