Coeure also commented that the uncertainty around the inflation outlook is receding and a sustained convergence of inflation to levels closer to our aim is in sight.

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US stocks finished lower with sentiment dampened on tariff-related fears after US President Trump declared he will be making an announcement regarding China after the market close. This pressured all US majors with the NASDAQ 100 the worst hit amid underperformance in tech and with AMZN hit on weekend news that the tech giant is investigating claims that staff leaked data in exchange for bribes. AAPL is said to be spared tariffs on its Watches, which helped lift its stock off session lows. While some reports suggested traders were booking profits as trade tensions, the downside in the tech giants in turn pressured the tech complex early in the cash day, setting a negative tone. Chip names were also subject to the trade fears theme. TWTR was hit after a downgrade at Moffett Nathanson. In M&amp;A, DOJ has cleared Cigna&rsquo;s (CI) acquisition of Express Scripts (ESRX), sending the latter surging higher. In other M&amp;A, US DOJ of CVS (CVS) planned acquisition of Aetna (AET) could be concluded by the end of the month, sources say. KR was higher after announcing a new fashion line. SPX -0.6% at 2888, NDX -1.5% at 7434, DJI -0.4% at 26062.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was much fanfare as 10-year yields once again crossed 3.00% to the upside as the Treasury complex was being sold pre-market (sympathy with bunds was also cited). However, as tech sold-off at the open, and a general fear of trade war escalation lingering in trader&rsquo;s minds, there was buying action pushing yields back beneath the psychological 3.00% handle. The story remains the same in the short-end with 2-year yields printing fresh decade+ highs. At settlement, however, yields were relatively unchanged on the day, and the curve had very, very modestly steepened. US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1+ ticks lower at 119-04.</p>\r\n",

However, that better than expected development was offset by a negative update from China; the WSJ reported that China is set to rebuff US overtures to resume trade talks after the fresh threat of tariffs from the US. On Monday, President Trump once again talked-up the tool of imposing tariffs, tweeting that tariffs have put the US in a very strong bargaining position, &quot;and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable,&quot; and added that &quot;if countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be &#39;tariffed&#39;.&quot; NEC Director Kudlow, speaking at the economic club of New York, said an announcement on the additional $200bln tariffs on China imports could be forthcoming soon, noting the US is ready negotiate with China anytime if they are ready for serious and substantive talks. He also reported to be constantly assessing the effects of tariffs on prices and noted US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin is in touch and is negotiating with Chinese officials, though Trump has not been satisfied with China talks so far. Separately, Kudlow anticipates more progress on trade with Canada, the EU and Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Both sides expressed optimism on a Brexit deal on Monday as EU Brexit Negotiator Barnier said Brexit talks are progressing in spirit of good cooperation, UK PM May Spokesman stated they are confident of reaching a Brexit deal and UK PM May stressed that it is now for the EU to respond to the proposals made by the UK, urging not to fall back on previous positions as she looks forward to agreeing on a good deal for the UK. As part of considerations to &quot;de-dramatise&quot; Brexit, Brussels and Ireland are discussing proposals to make British officials (as opposed to EU inspectors) responsible for checking goods coming into Northern Ireland. Over the weekend, former UK Foreign Secretary Johnson used an op-ed in the Telegraph to once again criticise PM May&#39;s Chequers Plan, though former Cabinet member and Brexiteer Gove in a weekend interview suggested that the plan will do for now, and that MPs could change the details in the future. Nonetheless, the Irish border remains a key sticking point in negotiations after the EU was secretly said to be prepared to accept a frictionless Irish border after Brexit in a move that raises the prospect of PM May striking a deal by the end of the year. Following the news, Northern Ireland&#39;s DUP deputy leader said it is imperative EU negotiators clarify revised backstop proposal as soon as possible as they will not accept anything that creates barriers within the UK and are unconvinced of a technological border. Finally, reports in Handelsblatt said the EU is to prepare emergency laws in case of a hard-Brexit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED: </strong>The San Fran Fed, which votes in 2018, has appointed Mary Daly as new President, effective 1 October, replacing the departed John Williams, who now heads-up the NY Fed. Deutsche Bank&rsquo;s analysts argue that her labour economist background will likely be a dovish voice in the room. Daly was said to sound optimistic on the economy in a recent speech, the bank notes, and appeared to be less concerned with softer wage readings than other doves, with Deutsche Bank suggesting that she seems more inclined to let the economy run hotter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US NY FED MANUFACTURING </strong>fell short of expectations and posted at 19 in September, consensus was for 23. Pantheon suggested that the figure was disappointing, particularly after a very solid ISM Manufacturing for August. Looking at the breakdown, shipments fell sharply, immediately followed by new orders and delivery which also posted a drop. Pantheon expects the data to augur a soft September Manufacturing PMI, though stresses that the two data points don&rsquo;t always move together. Their view, however, is that &ldquo;the rate of growth of output likely has peaked for this cycle but we see no evidence that a real slowdown is underway.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>AMZN was hit on weekend news that the tech giant is investigating claims that staff leaked data in exchange for bribes. AAPL is said to be spared tariffs on its Watches, which helped lift its stock off session lows. While some reports suggested traders were booking profits as trade tensions, the downside in the tech giants in turn pressured the tech complex early in the cash day, setting a negative tone. Chip names were also subject to the trade fears theme. TWTR was hit after a downgrade at Moffett Nathanson. In M&amp;A, DOJ has cleared Cigna&rsquo;s (CI) acquisition of Express Scripts (ESRX), sending the latter surging higher. In other M&amp;A, US DOJ of CVS (CVS) planned acquisition of Aetna (AET) could be concluded by the end of the month, sources say. KR was higher after announcing a new fashion line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (V8) SETTLES $0.08 LOWER AT $68.91/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.04 LOWER AT $78.05/BBL. </strong>Ahead of OPEC&rsquo;s meeting in Algiers on 23 September. Crude was trading lower on Monday. The meeting was initially intended to be a simple review of production data by monitoring committees, however, it has taken on more significance, and the members will be able to put forward and discuss multiple scenarios, according to Russia&rsquo;s energy minister Novak (who said he may discuss lifting production by more than 1mln BPD, as set out by OPEC/OPEC+). Citi&rsquo;s analysts would be surprised to see any fresh decisions on production policy until the full regular summit, which is scheduled for 3 December. &ldquo;Among other issues, we think the group will want to have more information on the impact of US sanctions on Iranian oil production. Russia&rsquo;s Novak expects compliance with the OPEC/OPEC+ output deal to be running at 108% in August (monitoring committees estimated 109% in July).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLES 1+ TICKS LOWER AT 191-04. </strong>There was much fanfare as 10-year yields once again crossed 3.00% to the upside as the Treasury complex was being sold pre-market (sympathy with bunds was also cited). However, as tech sold-off at the open, and a general fear of trade war escalation lingering in trader&rsquo;s minds, there was buying action pushing yields back beneath the psychological 3.00% handle. The story remains the same in the short-end with 2-year yields printing fresh decade+ highs. At settlement, however, yields were relatively unchanged on the day, and the curve had very, very modestly steepened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>* USD:</strong> There is not much on the slate this week that will * provide a catalyst for the USD to break away from consolidating in the 94.50-95.50 bracket, save the trade war tape bombs that have led to USD strength when there is a threat of escalation. That has left some desks to think about the stretched USD long positions, as reported in the CFTC data on Friday. SocGen&#39;s FX strategists have suggested it may be wise to hedge long USD positions into year-end, arguing that a fair amount of the USD-positive news is priced in. &quot;With the US economy doing well, the Fed on track to hike twice more this year and US trade policy inviting parallels with Florence and Mangkhut, there&rsquo;s support for the dollar but the uptrend is in final stages.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>EUR was unable to sustainably break above 1.17 to the upside last week, confined by range-bound trade; and despite the USD weakness against majors on Monday, the single currency found the air thin around that level. The single currency is also being supported by positive news on the Italian budget front, but fears of trade conflict escalations has kept some interest in the USD, capping the EUR&#39;s upside, given the tendency of the USD to usually appreciate amid Trade Wars headlines, and of course, the strong ties the EZ economy shares with China. &quot;We think that EUR will remain generally more resilient than other G10 currencies in the face of growing threat of escalating trade conflict between the US and China,&quot; Credit Agricole says. &quot;In particular, EUR should continue to benefit from evidence that the US and the EU have started moving closer to a trade deal and/or that the Italian government comes up with a budget proposal on 27 September that respects the EU rules.&quot; Additionally, although the ECB cut its near-term growth forecasts based on trade conflicts last week, President Draghi still sounded upbeat on the prospects for the economy, and stressed that the economy can remain resilient in the face of persistent global headwinds. However, some desks warn that the Italian Saga will unlikely be a straightforward affair, and warn about chasing EUR higher on this theme alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NOK: </strong>The Norwegian Krone was the top G10 performer on Monday, ahead of the Norges Bank rate decision on Thursday, where it is expected to lift rates for the first time in seven years. Nordea also looks for the central bank to lift its rate path through 2019 on the back of strong underlying inflation, weaker than expected NOK, as well as positive dynamics in the oil sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>The Loonie traded flat/slight higher against its US counterpart, taking its cue from some upbeat NAFTA comments, as well as a cue from positive oil moves in the afternoon, after Genscape was reported to forecast a draw of 2.2mln barrels at Cushing this week. Other than that, analysts say that to meaningfully break beneath the 1.30, trade headlines will need to provide support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Noises that the EU is becoming more flexible within Brexit negotiations has been supporting GBP ahead of Brexit talks later this week, which has seen policymakers express optimism. The weaker USD was also benefiting sterling on Monday, with cable back to the 1.3150 area, and EURGBP probing ground sub-0.89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD: </strong>Ahead of the RBA meeting minutes overnight, Aussie trades firm, shrugging off fears of trade war escalation. However, the Aussies&rsquo; strength may have been more a function of the USD selling against the majors.&nbsp; With regards to the RBA, the central bank is not expected to hike any time soon, and as such, traders will be focusing on the guidance aspects of the release, particularly on mortgage rates, after a number of Australian banks have lifted SVR in recent weeks.</p>\r\n",

Note, the index hit a recent low of around 94.350, and this now forms the nearest downside objective, if not chart support in the technical sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/NZD/EUR/AUD/CHF/SEK/NOK &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few changes within the ranks, but all extending gains and outperformance vs the Dollar, or against Eur in the case of the Sek and Nok. Cable benefited from more positive Brexit news to rebound towards 1.3150, while Eur/Gbp slipped back below 0.8900 amidst reports that the EU is open to a frictionless Irish border and UK officials overseeing customs checks on goods heading in to Northern Ireland. This, and an upbeat Buba monthly report also underpinned Eur/Usd, with the headline pair extending its rebound through 1.1650 and not far from 1.1700 where decent option expiry interest (1.3 bn) runs off at the NY cut. The Aud and Nzd also pared more losses vs their US peer from sub-0.7150 and 0.6550 overnight lows made after US President Trump threatened to action the pending $200 bn import tariffs on Chinese goods (albeit at 10% initially vs 25% proposed) to revisit levels not far from 0.7200 and 0.6600, while the Franc strengthened from circa 0.9680 to around 0.9620 ahead of Thursday&rsquo;s SNB quarterly policy review. Turning to the Scandis, both derived more traction on Central Bank dynamics with a Norges Bank widely if not universally expected this week (also Thursday) and minutes from the Riksbank underscoring guidance for tightening in either December or February 2019. Eur/Nok probing under 9.5550, Eur/Sek below 10.4450.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relative G10 laggards all day, with the Loonie capped below 1.3000, albeit just and Usd/Jpy pivoting around 112.00, with a lack of fresh news/progress on NAFTA and Japanese markets observing a public holiday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Try back in the spotlight and succumbing to renewed selling pressure ahead of Turkey&rsquo;s medium term economic plan later this week, with only brief respite from better than forecast ip data. Lira now licking wounds around 6.3000 vs the Usd, while the Rand recovered from 15.0000+ lows vs the Usd ahead of SA August inflation data, the SARB policy meeting and President Ramaphosa pledging no mass public sector lay-offs.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, separate reports over the weekend stated that the tariffs will go into effect within weeks and that an announcement could be made within days, while the tariffs are said to likely be set at about 10% but could be raised to 25% if China does not appear willing to comply to US trade demands at proposed meetings in Washington on September 27th-28th. Additionally US President Trump tweeted &quot;Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position&quot; and &quot;If countries will not make fair deals they will be &ldquo;Tariffed!&quot;&quot; (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China reportedly may not participate in planned trade discussions with the US if the Trump administration goes ahead with additional tariffs. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G-20 ministers issued statement which noted that they discussed ways to improve the WTO and that said there is urgent need to improve the WTO, while it also noted that they stepped up dialogue on international trade. G20 ministers also stated the EU-Mercosur free trade deal involving Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Venezuela is &#39;in the final stages&#39; of negotiation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian equity markets began the week with a subdued tone amid the absence of Japanese participants due to public holiday and with sentiment dampened by trade concerns after US President Trump reportedly told advisers to proceed with tariffs on a further USD 200bln of Chinese goods which could be announced as early as today. Furthermore, reports noted the tariffs could be set at about 10% and raised to 25% if China shows an unwillingness to adhere to US demands at proposed meetings later this month, while China was said to consider abandoning discussions if the US proceeds with the tariffs. This pressured both ASX 200 (+0.3%) and KOSPI (-0.7%) from the open with healthcare the underperformer in Australia as the sector faces scrutiny from a royal commission inquiry, although the index later recovered amid strength in utilities, tech and financials. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-1.3%) and Shanghai Comp.

In a concession to British concerns, EU negotiators intend to use technological solutions to minimise customs checks between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic (Times) Further to this, the FT reported that the EU are in discussions with Brussels over allowing British officials (as opposed to EU ones), to check goods bound for Northern Ireland, in a bid to unlock stalled talks on the &ldquo;backstop&rdquo; plan for the Irish border. (FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former UK Foreign Minister Johnson has continued to criticise UK PM May&rsquo;s Chequers proposal by stating that May was leading the nation towards a &lsquo;spectacular political car crash&rsquo;.

Furthermore, Makuch stated we&rsquo;re not underestimating the risks and based on what we know now, the development is stable and risks are balanced with some downside risks to GDP growth, while he added we don&rsquo;t see any reason to spread a gloomy mood or panic.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equites started the day negative as the negative tone driven by US-China trade concerns in Asia extended into European trade. Stocks directionless now, however, and the IBEX is outperforming, with the DAX the underperformer. The German index is being weighed on by falling Linde shares, as more divestments by Praxair may be necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements ahead of their possible tie-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and broad Usd have lost some ground in early EU trade amidst a general upturn in risk sentiment/appetite, on more positive Italian fiscal vibes and latest reports about the EU looking at ways to resolve differences over the Irish border that could pave the way for a Brexit deal with the UK, or at least raise prospects of an accord. The DXY has drifted back from just a fraction below 95.000 overnight towards 94.725 after extending post-US data gains on Friday with the added impetus of President Trump upping the ante on $200 bn Chinese import tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CHF/EUR/GBP&nbsp; - All firmer vs the Greenback and marginally outperforming other majors, bar the Scandi crowns that are benefiting from relative Norges Bank and Riksbank policy outlooks vs the ECB especially, but for the former also against the Fed in the very near term given overwhelming expectations for a 25 bp hike this Thursday. The Kiwi has reclaimed 0.6550+ status, the Aud is back over 0.7150 and the Franc has rebounded through 0.9650, while the single currency has bounced firmly off 10 and 21 DMAs circa 1.1616 to test offers/resistance around 1.1650 and Cable is looking at 1.3100 again. Back to the Nok and Sek, both have extended gains vs the Eur to trade around 9.5750 and 10.4750 respectively, and with the latter seemingly latching on to the more hawkish elements of latest policy meeting minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - Lagging G10 peers on renewed global trade jitters, with Usd/Jpy straddling 112.00 and the Loonie meandering between 1.3050-17 on no further progress towards a NAFTA deal following the latest round of talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Try has been back in the spotlight and renewed pressure after last week&rsquo;s massive CBRT boost, with a retreat to almost 6.3000 before some losses were clawed back with the aid of better than forecast Turkish ip data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ranges remain relatively tight at the core, but in rather choppy markets there are a few clearer patterns evident and perhaps becoming more pronounced. Bunds have succumbed to more downside, albeit gradually, and have now breached near term chart support around 159.12 to test underlying buying interest around 159.00 at 158.97 (-20 ticks), while Italian BTPs look a bit more comfortable above 126.00 and climbed to 126.26 at best (+106 ticks). Gilts stretched their Liffe parameters to the upside earlier, reaching 121.61 (+13 ticks vs -8 ticks at the low) for no obvious reason at the time, but have retreated since to re-test the lows, while US Treasuries have slipped to fresh overnight session lows with the 10 year yield nudging 3% again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil sector is marginally positive as the USD is easing slightly, with&nbsp; WTI finding some support from its 100DMA at USD 68.89, currently trading around the USD 69.50 level.

Stocks directionless now, however, and the IBEX is outperforming, with the DAX the underperformer. The German index is being weighed on by falling Linde shares, as more divestments by Praxair may be necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements ahead of their possible tie-up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H&amp;M are leading the gains in the Stoxx 600, as the Swedish retailer reported inspiring sales figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index and broad Usd have lost some ground in early EU trade amidst a general upturn in risk sentiment/appetite, on more positive Italian fiscal vibes and latest reports about the EU looking at ways to resolve differences over the Irish border that could pave the way for a Brexit deal with the UK, or at least raise prospects of an accord. The DXY has drifted back from just a fraction below 95.000 overnight towards 94.725 after extending post-US data gains on Friday with the added impetus of President Trump upping the ante on $200 bn Chinese import tariffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/CHF/EUR/GBP&nbsp; - All firmer vs the Greenback and marginally outperforming other majors, bar the Scandi crowns that are benefiting from relative Norges Bank and Riksbank policy outlooks vs the ECB especially, but for the former also against the Fed in the very near term given overwhelming expectations for a 25 bp hike this Thursday. The Kiwi has reclaimed 0.6550+ status, the Aud is back over 0.7150 and the Franc has rebounded through 0.9650, while the single currency has bounced firmly off 10 and 21 DMAs circa 1.1616 to test offers/resistance around 1.1650 and Cable is looking at 1.3100 again. Back to the Nok and Sek, both have extended gains vs the Eur to trade around 9.5750 and 10.4750 respectively, and with the latter seemingly latching on to the more hawkish elements of latest policy meeting minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CAD - Lagging G10 peers on renewed global trade jitters, with Usd/Jpy straddling 112.00 and the Loonie meandering between 1.3050-25 on no further progress towards a NAFTA deal following the latest round of talks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The Try has been back in the spotlight and renewed pressure after last week&rsquo;s massive CBRT boost, with a retreat to almost 6.3000 before some losses were clawed back with the aid of better than forecast Turkish ip data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ranges remain relatively tight at the core, but in rather choppy markets there are a few clearer patterns evident and perhaps becoming more pronounced. Bunds have succumbed to more downside, albeit gradually, and have now breached near term chart support around 159.12 to test underlying buying interest around 159.00 at 158.97 (-20 ticks), while Italian BTPs look a bit more comfortable above 126.00 and climbed to 126.26 at best (+106 ticks). Gilts stretched their Liffe parameters to the upside earlier, reaching 121.61 (+13 ticks vs -8 ticks at the low) for no obvious reason at the time, but have retreated since to re-test the lows, while US Treasuries have slipped to fresh overnight session lows with the 10 year yield nudging 3% again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil sector is marginally positive as the USD is easing slightly, with&nbsp; WTI finding some support from its 100DMA at USD 68.89, currently trading around the USD 69.50 level. Traders remain mindful of the impact of Tropical Depression Florence, as ports remain shut in North Carolina due to flooding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia Energy Minister Al-Falih and Russian counterpart Novak met over the weekend in which they pledged to continue working on cooperation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is currently benefitting from a softer dollar and US-China trade tensions, with the yellow metal lagging at the USD 1195/oz level. Base metals have dropped on increased trade concerns, with both copper and nickel both down over 1.5%.</p>\r\n",
