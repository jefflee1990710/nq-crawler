(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>India could raise its imports of US oil and gas with a rising demand while US and Indian officials are said to have identified mutual areas of trade co-operation and have a list of items covering new goods and services for trade, according to an Indian trade source. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Haldane said lifting rates would still leave UK monetary conditions &quot;extraordinarily &quot; accommodative historically and said he does not expect a faster pace of interest rate hikes than envisaged in May. (Newswires)<br />Note: Haldane was one of the 3 dissenting votes in the most recent BoE rate decision, while the BoE&#39;s May QIR suggested the BoE saw around three hikes over the forecast period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said both sides are committed to a faster pace of Brexit negotiations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&#39;s Juncker stated that he doesn&rsquo;t have to lecture PM May but he would like the UK to make clear their positions, while he added that we can&#39;t go on with a split cabinet and that they have to say what they want. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU leaders failed to formally approve a final EU summit joint conclusions statement after Italy blocked all agreements until demands regarding migration were included in the final conclusions. Furthermore, Italy was also said to be unlikely to accept an EU migration deal which does not include a reform of Dublin treaty, common responsibility on rescue of migrants, or a significant increase in funds for Africa, according to an Italian government source. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said EU came to him to negotiate on trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Consumer Confidence Final (Jun) -0.5 vs. Exp. -0.5 (Prev. 0.2).

(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi June oil exports are currently in the 7.6-7.7 million bpd range, according to Energy Intelligence. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Energy Secretary Perry said he hopes OPEC members will fill oil supply gap left by Iran sanctions, while he is also said to be comfortable Saudi and Russia can increase production to stabilise the oil market. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK union voted to strike at the North Sea Total Oil and Gas fields. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (Voter, Dove) said he is comfortable with slowing the pace of rate hikes and that economic expansion has been steady with few surprises. Bostic also commented the fed is worried about overheating and he is concerned about an unpleasant economic snapback. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Bullard (Non-voter, Dove) said risk of inversion should result in the Fed to slow down rate hikes until it is obvious that inflation pressures or long-term yields are increasing, while he also commented that it does not look like there is much inflation risk today. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Non-voter, Dove) said Fed could be one or two hikes from the neutral rate and that he favours pausing when that level is reached. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Fed approved 34 of 35 capital plans in the second part of the bank stress tests, with Deutsche Bank&#39;s (DBK GY) US operations failing due to material weakness in data capabilities and controls.

The E-mini S&amp;P had dropped below 2700 for the first time since late May but later bounced. There was little in the way of newsflow which may have helped the general picture as trade wars took a back seat and risk sentiment improved in the US. Sectorwise, Pharmacy names were hit following Amazon&rsquo;s (AMZN) acquisition of Pillpack, an online pharmacy that offers pre-sorted doses of medications and offers home delivery. Elsewhere, Accenture (ACN) and McCormick (MKC) both outperformed in the SPX on Thursday following strong earnings reports. Walgreens (WBA) also reported earnings which beat on its EPS but revenue fell slightly short. WBA also announced a USD 10bln share buyback programme, however any gains were lost due to Amazon&rsquo;s venture into the healthcare market which was announced pre-market. SPX +0.63% at 2717, NASDAQ COMP. +0.9% at 7031, DJIA +0.42% at 24218.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Treasuries fell on Thursday with the 10y yield rising circa 2bps after being in a narrow range for much of the session. The 7y note auction went off without a hitch with the yield stopping on the screws and the line covered 2.53x, in line with the 6-auction average. IFR noted much of the activity was seen as quarter-end and month-end portfolio rebalancing with the geopolitical and trade news relatively quiet. US 10YR T-notes futures (Sep 2018) settle 6+ ticks lower at 120-06.</p>\r\n",

Bostic is generally dovish leaning so the comments shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise and previously he said he favours just one further rate hike this year, lower than the median of 2. Kashkari also spoke in late trade where he said the fed could be one or two hikes away from the neutral rate, and that he does favour pausing when this level is hit. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* OTHER CENTRAL BANKS: </strong>After dissenting at last weeks monetary policy meeting, BoE chief economist Haldane said that markets should not be surprised by his willingness to hike rates 25bps and that a move higher would still leave monetary conditions extraordinarily accommodative by historical standards. He later also clarified that he doesn&rsquo;t expect a faster pace of interest rate hikes than that envisaged by the BoE at the quarterly inflation report in May. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* DATA:</strong> Q1 GDP was revised lower to 2.0% from 2.2% as consumer spending was at its weakest in nearly five years. Nevertheless, Q2 growth looks set to race higher with the most recent Atlanta Fed GDP forecast at 4.5%. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* SPX +0.63% at 2717, NASDAQ COMP &nbsp;+0.9% at 7031, DJI &nbsp;+0.42% at 24218.</strong> SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals +0.85%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.30%, Energy: -0.17%, Financials: +0.94%, Health Care: +0.45%, Industrials: +0.32%, Materials: +0.47%, Telecoms: +2.44%, Tech: +1.20%, Utilities: +0.01%. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>US equity futures drifted higher from the open after initially trading lower throughout the European morning. The E-mini S&amp;P had dropped below 2700 for the first time since late May but later bounced. There was little in the way of newsflow which may have helped the general picture as trade wars took a back seat and risk sentiment improved in the US. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />* EARNINGS: Accenture (ACN) and McCormick (MKC) both outperformed in the SPX on Thursday following strong earnings reports. Walgreens (WBA) also reported earnings which beat on its EPS but revenue fell slightly short. WBA also announced a USD 10bln share buyback programme, however any gains were lost due to Amazon&rsquo;s venture into the healthcare market which was announced pre-market. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS:</strong> Pharmacy names were hit following Amazon&rsquo;s (AMZN) acquisition of Pillpack, an online pharmacy that offers pre-sorted doses of medications and offers home delivery. This hurt Retail pharmacy names such as Walgreens (WBA), Rite Aid (RAD), who both reported earnings, and CVS Health (CVS). Elsewhere, Chipotle (CMG) were also at the&nbsp;<br />bottom of the SPX, following the closure of 65 underperforming stores. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* M&amp;A</strong>: Chinese regulatory authorities granted acquisition approval to Marvell Technology (MRVL) for the takeover of Cavium. In smaller M&amp;A news, Akebia (AKBA) and Keryx (KERX) are to combine in an all-stock merger, to create a biopharmaceutical company which will focus on chronic kidney disease. In late trade, Synnex (SNX) is reportedly near a deal to acquire Convergys (CVG) for USD 26.50/shr, or USD 2.4bln, according to WSJ citing sources. This boosted CVG shares but SNX shares were hit. This deal had previously touted at before on the 19th of June where reports suggested that the two were in discussions. &nbsp;<br /><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (SEP 2018) &nbsp;SETTLE 6+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-06. &nbsp;</strong><br />US Treasuries fell on Thursday with the 10y yield rising circa 2bps after being in a narrow range for much of the session. The 7y note auction went off without a hitch with the yield stopping on the screws and the line covered 2.53x, in line with the 6-auction average. IFR noted much of the activity was seen as quarter-end and month-end portfolio rebalancing with the geopolitical and trade news relatively quiet. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><strong>* WTI Crude futures (Q8) settle 69c higher at USD 73.45/bbl; Brent crude futures (Q8) settle 23c higher at USD 77.85/bbl &nbsp;</strong><br />WTI accelerated from previous gains outperforming Brent which settled only slightly higher. News flow for the oil complex has slowed down today compared to recent days. Nonetheless, Libya&rsquo;s oil production has returned to 700k BPD following the conflict in the eastern regions where 450k BPD of production was lost. Libya&rsquo;s NOC then instructed the companies in the east to halt their oil exports.&nbsp;<br />Following on from reports on Tuesday that the US is pushing allies to get oil imports from Iran to 0, India have reportedly acknowledged this with sources stating refiners have been told to prepare for this scenario by November. US Energy Secretary Perry says he hopes that OPEC members will fill out the supply gap left by sanctions on Iran, and said he is comfortable the Saudi&rsquo;s and Russia can increase production to keep the oil market stable.&nbsp;<br />WTI did spike higher in early trade among no fundamental reasoning where it breached 73/bbl to the upside before calming down and settling just above this level and just off highs. Brent did see similar price action however it was not to the same extent.&nbsp;<br /><strong>* FX&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong>DXY </strong>held onto a 95.00 handle in what was a relatively indecisive session for FX markets with trade headlines on the light-side. Initial modest USD strength was short-lived. Some&nbsp;commentators highlighted month-end rebalancing flows coming into-play with models suggesting the USD could be sold amid equity re-balancing. This amid a lack of other noteworthy catalysts saw EUR/USD eye 1.1600 to the upside, albeit without much in the way of firm conviction with German CPI unable to provide any further support for prices with both M/M and Y/Y metrics printing in-line with expectations ahead of the EZ-wide figure tomorrow. Elsewhere on the data front, sentiment for the USD was also partially soured by Q1 final GDP being unexpectedly revised lower to 2.0% from 2.2%.&nbsp;<br />In the broader FX-sphere, GBP managed to recoup some of initial losses against the USD (albeit still on a 1.3000 handle) after taking out stops to the downside at 1.3100 early doors in Europe before then running into support around 7-month lows at 1.3068. BoE&rsquo;s Haldane justified his decision last week to opt for a vote hike by stating that lifting rates would still leave UK monetary conditions &quot;extraordinarily &quot; accommodative historically. Focus now on Brexit with EU&rsquo;s Juncker demanding the PM May makes it clear &ldquo;what she wants&rdquo;.&nbsp;<br />Rangebound trade for <strong>USD/JPY </strong>as the greenback and JPY took guidance from the broader risk sentiment; USD/JPY maintained a 110.00 handle throughout the session. As US equities trended higher throughout the afternoon, USD/JPY pushed above 110.50. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>NZD </strong>continued its recent slide with the latest catalyst being that of last night&rsquo;s RBNZ policy announcement which saw the bank keep rates unchanged as expected and reiterate that rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced. From a technical perspective, with the recent move to the downside leading to fresh 2018 lows, the next target to the downside for markets after the psychological 0.6700 figure could be that of the May 2016 low at 0.6676.&nbsp;<br />Yesterday&rsquo;s losses for the<strong> CAD</strong> vs. the USD post-Poloz proved to be short-lived with broader USD-softness and firmer energy prices outweighing comments from the central bank head who took time to note the uncertainties facing the Canadian economy which saw pricing for a rate hike decline to beneath 50%.&nbsp;<br />Finally, speculation did the rounds regarding SNB intervention which saw <strong>EUR/CHF</strong> pull away from the 1.1500 handle. As ever, such intervention will never be confirmed by the Bank but many in the market suggest the SNB may have been the driving force behind the moves</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>DXY held onto a 95.00 handle in what was a relatively indecisive session for FX markets with trade headlines on the light-side. Initial modest USD strength was short-lived. Some commentators highlighted month-end rebalancing flows coming into-play with models suggesting the USD could be sold amid equity re-balancing. This amid a lack of other noteworthy catalysts saw EUR/USD eye 1.1600 to the upside, albeit without much in the way of firm conviction with German CPI unable to provide any further support for prices with both M/M and Y/Y metrics printing in-line with expectations ahead of the EZ-wide figure tomorrow. Elsewhere on the data front, sentiment for the USD was also partially soured by Q1 final GDP being unexpectedly revised lower to 2.0% from 2.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the broader FX-sphere, GBP managed to recoup some of initial losses against the USD (albeit still on a 1.3000 handle) after taking out stops to the downside at 1.3100 early doors in Europe before then running into support around 7-month lows at 1.3068. BoE&rsquo;s Haldane justified his decision last week to opt for a vote hike by stating that lifting rates would still leave UK monetary conditions &quot;extraordinarily &quot; accommodative historically. Focus now on Brexit with EU&rsquo;s Juncker demanding the PM May makes it clear &ldquo;what she wants&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rangebound trade for USD/JPY as the greenback and JPY took guidance from the broader risk sentiment; USD/JPY maintained a 110.00 handle throughout the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD continued its recent slide with the latest catalyst being that of last night&rsquo;s RBNZ policy announcement which saw the bank keep rates unchanged as expected and reiterate that rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced. From a technical perspective, with the recent move to the downside leading to fresh 2018 lows, the next target to the downside for markets after the psychological 0.6700 figure could be that of the May 2016 low at 0.6676.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s losses for the CAD vs. the USD post-Poloz proved to be short-lived with broader USD-softness and firmer energy prices outweighing comments from the central bank head who took time to note the uncertainties facing the Canadian economy which saw pricing for a rate hike decline to beneath 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, speculation did the rounds regarding SNB intervention which saw the cross pull away from the 1.1500 handle. As ever, such intervention will never be confirmed by the Bank but many in the market suggest the SNB may have been the driving force behind the moves given the counter-intuitive nature of the price action in a risk-averse market.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch) were mixed with Australia kept afloat by commodity names as the energy sector outperformed on further gains in crude, while a firmer currency and disappointing Retail Sales data weighed on sentiment in Tokyo. Hang Seng (+0.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) were choppy on the trade uncertainties and following another net liquidity drain by the PBoC, although Chinese stocks later recovered amid pre-emptive measures in the face of a looming trade war including a further devaluation of the currency and adjustments of tariffs on some imports from other Asia-Pac nations.&nbsp; Finally, 10yr JGBs traded flat amid the indecisive risk tone and amid weaker demand at today&rsquo;s 2yr auction later, in which accepted prices also declined from prior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 80bln via 7-day reverse repos, for a net daily drain of CNY 100bln. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.5960 (Prev. 6.5569)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China Mofcom said US planned curbs on technology exports to China could backfire and that it does not support using national security as a basis for investment restrictions, while Mofcom also announced it will adjust tariffs on an array of imports from several Asia-Pac countries effective July 1st.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ maintained the Official Cash Rate at 1.75% as unanimously expected, while it reiterated that it expects to keep rates at current expansionary level for considerable period and that the next direction is equally balanced between up and down. RBNZ added that global economic growth is likely to underpin demand for New Zealand products and services, but also stated that recent weaker GDP implies marginally more spare capacity in economy than anticipated and that CPI remains below target. Furthermore, the RBNZ later announced from 2019 onwards rate decisions will be announced after 1400 local time on a Wednesday and implemented the following day. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 27 EU leaders are to raise the pressure on UK PM May by warning her about the growing risk of a no-deal Brexit. (The Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Trade Minister Fox said early evidence suggests safeguards may be needed to protect the steel industry following the US tariffs. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Interior Minister Seehofer said the CSU party is not seeking a break-up of the coalition government nor oust Chancellor Merkel, while there were also comments from German Finance Minister Scholz said he does not rule out possibility coalition can reach solution to migration issue. &nbsp;(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>German Chancellor Merkel said on migration, &ldquo;we are not where we want to be yet&rdquo;; adding &ldquo;we won&#39;t be able to reach a common migration agreement at the June Summit&rdquo;. She went on to say Germany must consider coalition of the willing on migrant policy if an agreement is not reached by the 28 EU members and the migrant policy may make or break the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finnish PM said he ready to agree a deal with German Chancellor Merkel on immigration within the EU.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities are lower across the board (Eurostoxx 50 -0.6%) in recent trade with all major bourses in the red as trade tensions continue to weigh on sentiment. Consumer staples outperform while IT names lag behind (Europe&rsquo;s tech sector -1.7%) amid NEC Director Kudlow rejecting the notion that US President Trump has softened his stance in regards to China on foreign investment, adding that the approach is aimed at &ldquo;protecting our technological family jewels&rdquo;. In terms of stocks specifics, Shire (+2.1%) shares are higher after Takeda shareholders rejected a proposal which opposed a deal with Shire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY remains above 95.00 in European trade after an early bout of strength (now off best-levels) with trade posturing remaining a key focus for investor sentiment. In terms of the latest state-of-play, trade uncertainties remain in focus after White House economic adviser Kudlow rejected the perception that Trump was softening his stance on China. Markets continue to weigh counter-measures from China with CNY devaluation increasingly becoming part of the narrative in the spat between the two nations with China also announcing adjustments of tariffs on some imports from other Asia-Pac nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD strength has somewhat abated as the session progresses with some commentators highlighting month-end rebalancing flows set to come into-play. Models suggest the USD could be sold amid equity re-balancing and thus provide some support for EUR/USD which has thus far been able to maintain at 1.1500 handle. This morning&rsquo;s regional German CPI releases have indicated a pattern of declining rates for both the M/M and Y/Y (in-fitting with consensus for the mainland figures at 1300BST) but failed to spur much in the way of noteworthy price action for the multi-bloc currency. Today once again sees a slew of noteworthy option expiries; 1.1500 (1BLN), 1.1585-1.1600 (1.8BLN), 1.1640-50 (1.5BLN), 1.1660-80 (1.2BLN), 1.1700 (1BLN).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP has managed to recoup some of it&rsquo;s initial losses against the USD (albeit still on a 1.3000 handle) after taking out stops to the downside at 1.3100 early doors in Europe before then running into support around 7-month lows at 1.3068. From a fundamental perspective, BoE&rsquo;s Cunliffe did little to reveal his voting intentions at the August QIR and instead focused on household debt with a more medium-term focus. Narrative for the GBP could now shift towards Brexit ahead of the EU leaders summit; albeit expectations for any progress are particularly low with PM May set to get a slap on the wrist from her peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/CAD is continuing to return to pre-Poloz levels amid USD softening after the BoC head took time to note the uncertainties facing the Canadian economy which saw pricing for a rate hike decline to beneath 50%. Large option expiries could come into play for CAD with 1.3bln in USD/CAD at 1.3345-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD has continued its recent slide with the latest catalyst being that of last night&rsquo;s RBNZ policy announcement which saw the bank keep rates unchanged as expected and reiterate that rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced. From a technical perspective, with the recent move to the downside leading to fresh 2018 lows, the next target to the downside for markets after the psychological 0.6700 figure could be that of the May 2016 low at 0.6676.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a firmer start to the session for Bunds, support for paper abated amid the modest turnaround in sentiment seen just after the cash equity open. However, in what has been a choppy morning thus far for paper, the German 10yr once again reversed course and tested (unsuccessfully) yesterday&rsquo;s high of 162.55 to the upside. Focus for German paper will likely continue to focus on political risk as Merkel attempts to avert a collapse in her CDU/CSU alliance as she aims to strike a compromise with her Bavarian counterpart regrading immigration demands. From a UK perspective, the UK 10yr trades with little in the way of firm direction with politics also set to be at the forefront of investor sentiment as PM May heads to Brussels. BoE Agents&rsquo; summary of business conditions did little to spur price action after noting that retail sales growth had ticked up over the past month, boosted by stronger sales of seasonal clothing and footwear; growth in consumer services had slowed. Initial BTP strength faded after supply was absorbed by the market with the IT/GE 10yr spread continuing to widen with the Italy 10yr drawing the softest b/c at auction since the beginning of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities are mixed with choppy trade in gold (unch) after initially hitting 6-month lows as the yellow metal tracks the change in the dollar. WTI (+0.3%) and Brent (+0.1%) are back in positive territory, printing fresh highs for the day at USD 72.87/bbl and USD 77.93/bbl respectively. During the week, API and EIA crude inventories printed the largest drawdown since September 2016 with oil stocks dropping by nearly 10mln barrels.

Consumer staples outperform while IT names lag behind amid NEC Director Kudlow rejecting the notion that US President Trump has softened his stance in regards to China on foreign investment, adding that the approach is aimed at &ldquo;protecting our technological family jewels&rdquo;. In terms of stocks specifics, Shire (+2.3%) shares are higher after Takeda shareholders rejected a proposal which opposed a deal with Shire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY remains above 95.00 in European trade after an early bout of strength (now off best-levels) with trade posturing remaining a key focus for investor sentiment. In terms of the latest state-of-play, trade uncertainties remain in focus after White House economic adviser Kudlow rejected the perception that Trump was softening his stance on China. Markets continue to weigh counter-measures from China with CNY devaluation increasingly becoming part of the narrative in the spat between the two nations with China also announcing adjustments of tariffs on some imports from other Asia-Pac nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD strength has somewhat abated as the session progresses with some commentators highlighting month-end rebalancing flows set to come into-play. Models suggest the USD could be sold amid equity re-balancing and thus provide some support for EUR/USD which has thus far been able to maintain at 1.1500 handle. This morning&rsquo;s regional German CPI releases have indicated a pattern of declining rates for both the M/M and Y/Y (in-fitting with consensus for the mainland figures at 1300BST) but failed to spur much in the way of noteworthy price action for the multi-bloc currency. Today once again sees a slew of noteworthy option expiries; 1.1500 (1BLN), 1.1585-1.1600 (1.8BLN), 1.1640-50 (1.5BLN), 1.1660-80 (1.2BLN), 1.1700 (1BLN).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP has managed to recoup some of it&rsquo;s initial losses against the USD (albeit still on a 1.3000 handle) after taking out stops to the downside at 1.3100 early doors in Europe before then running into support around 7-month lows at 1.3068. From a fundamental perspective, BoE&rsquo;s Cunliffe did little to reveal his voting intentions at the August QIR and instead focused on household debt with a more medium-term focus. Narrative for the GBP could now shift towards Brexit ahead of the EU leaders summit; albeit expectations for any progress are particularly low with PM May set to get a slap on the wrist from her peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD/CAD is continuing to return to pre-Poloz levels amid USD softening after the BoC head took time to note the uncertainties facing the Canadian economy which saw pricing for a rate hike decline to beneath 50%. Large option expiries could come into play for CAD with 1.3bln in USD/CAD at 1.3345-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD has continued its recent slide with the latest catalyst being that of last night&rsquo;s RBNZ policy announcement which saw the bank keep rates unchanged as expected and reiterate that rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced. From a technical perspective, with the recent move to the downside leading to fresh 2018 lows, the next target to the downside for markets after the psychological 0.6700 figure could be that of the May 2016 low at 0.6676.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED</strong> <strong>INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite a firmer start to the session for Bunds, support for paper abated amid the modest turnaround in sentiment seen just after the cash equity open. Subsequently the German 10yr was unable to make a test of yesterday&rsquo;s high of 162.55 after running out of steam at 162.48. Focus for German paper will likely continue to focus on political risk as Merkel attempts to avert a collapse in her CDU/CSU alliance as she aims to strike a compromise with her Bavarian counterpart regrading immigration demands. From a UK perspective, the UK 10yr trades with little in the way of firm direction with politics also set to be at the forefront of investor sentiment as PM May heads to Brussels. BoE Agents&rsquo; summary of business conditions did little to spur price action after noting that retail sales growth had ticked up over the past month, boosted by stronger sales of seasonal clothing and footwear; growth in consumer services had slowed. BTPs are slightly firmer ahead of impending supply and amid reports that Italy is to not pass income tax reductions next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities trade lower with gold (-0.4%) hitting 6-month lows as the yellow metal tracks the firmer dollar. WTI (-0.4%) and Brent&nbsp; (-0.3%) pull back from intraday highs of USD 72.79/bbl and USD 77.81/bbl respectively with very little newsflow influencing the energies in recent trade. During the week, API and EIA crude inventories printed the largest drawdown since September 2016 with oil stocks dropping by nearly 10mln barrels. Traders will be mindful of halted oil exports in Libya following the country&rsquo;s Eastern NOC&rsquo;s instructions.</p>\r\n",

German Chancellor Merkel has been facing a domestic battle over migration with CSU coalition partners, which want ot pursue a more hard line approach to immigration. The CSU has given Chancellor Merkel a two-week grace period (due to expire at the start of July) to strike a deal with EU partners to redistribute EU registered migrants in the bloc, to put less pressure on German borders. The subject has threatened the stability of the CDU/CSU coalition, and investors fear that without the support of the CSU, Merkel&rsquo;s CDU would no longer have a parliamentary majority. While some CSU leaders have expressed scepticism that a deal can be reached with the EU, leader Seehofer has said a coalition breakup is unlikely; however, Chancellor Merkel said on Thursday the migrant policy may be a make or break for the EU. Note: The CSU/CDU fear that the far right AfD could make headway in Bavarian state elections in October if CSU/CDU pursue a soft approach with regards to immigration, and unity between the CDU/CSU will be required to stem the AfD&rsquo;s rise (it has been gaining in recent polls). At the same time, the new Italian government is calling for more immigration burden-sharing; Deputy PM and far-right League leader Salvini has pushed back on immigration, turning away migrant ships, and his aggressive approach may risk conflict with the Germans, according to some analysts. A favourable outcome may be difficult to achieve after last weekend&rsquo;s emergency Summit, where EU partners debated migration in a &ldquo;frank and open&rdquo; manner, though no concrete consequences or conclusions were agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BREXIT</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agenda pencilled in only two hours of Brexit talks on Friday. The Irish border issue continues to be an obstacle that stunts any development. The European Council in an EU 27 format (excluding UK) is to review the state of play of Brexit negotiations and come to a conclusion on progress made. EU Leaders said on Tuesday that the door has been left open to the UK to change their &ldquo;red line&rdquo; in Brexit negotiations; according to the draft Summit conclusions. No breakthroughs are expected before the Summit, which will pile on more pressure on UK and EC negotiators. According to a UK statement, UK PM May said the UK will provide more detail on their vision for the future UK-EU relations in a white paper after the June Summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US AUTO TARIFFS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump has threatened to apply 20% tariffs on imports of EU autos to the US if the EU did not &lsquo;break down and remove&rsquo; its own tariffs on US autos. Reports suggest leaders will discuss a response at the Summit. The EU has previously intimated that it will apply counter-measures on US trade manoeuvres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU BUDGET</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The French-German proposal for a Eurozone budget is not a new stand-alone budget but part of a multi-annual budget for the EU. One part of the budget is to be devoted to investment (related to structural improvement of the economy) while the second would be a macroeconomic stabilisation function. It may be worthwhile to focus on how large the budget will be. French President Macron sees the budget to be hundreds of billions of euros, while German Chancellor Merkel sees it to be in the &ldquo;low double-digit&rdquo; billions. ING notes that there is &ldquo;still a long way to go but a small budget line in the EU&rsquo;s multi-annual fiscal framework as a kind of &ldquo;money for reforms&rdquo; or conditional cross-border investment fund looks feasible&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

This kept the DXY above the 95.00 level, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD languished near the prior session&rsquo;s lows at the 1.1500 and 1.3100 handles respectively. Elsewhere, the cautious tone spurred mild flows into JPY in which USD/JPY briefly tested 110.00 to the downside, while antipodeans were mixed as AUD nursed losses and with NZD softer after the RBNZ decision to keep rates unchanged as expected, in which it reiterated that rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBNZ maintained the Official Cash Rate at 1.75% as unanimously expected, while it reiterated that it expects to keep rates at current expansionary level for considerable period and that the next direction is equally balanced between up and down. RBNZ added that global economic growth is likely to underpin demand for New Zealand products and services, but also stated that recent weaker GDP implies marginally more spare capacity in economy than anticipated and that CPI remains below target. Furthermore, the RBNZ later announced from 2019 onwards rate decisions will be announced after 1400 local time on a Wednesday and implemented the following day.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were slightly softer overnight with WTI crude futures pulling back mildly overnight following its recent advances which pushed prices to their highest in over 3 years, with support this week due to ongoing supply uncertainty regarding Iran sanctions as well as the mammoth drawdowns to stockpiles in both API and DoE inventories. Elsewhere, gold was uneventful with the precious metal restricted as USD remained firm, while an indecisive risk tone also kept copper range-bound.<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the Trump Administration announcing trade measures that are not extreme as some had feared, Treasury yields were lower across the curve, with &lsquo;growth concerns&rsquo; being cited. The 30-year yield dropped beneath 3% again, and 10-year yields are a couple of basis points above 2.80%. The result was 2s10s flattening to the lowest level since 2007. Some suggested that Treasury were moving in sympathy with Bunds in the pre-market, with German debt in demand after the row between the German government coalition over immigration.

ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch) were mixed with Australia kept afloat by commodity names as the energy sector outperformed on further gains in crude and with Santos underpinned after the board approved a new dividend policy which targets paying 10%-30% of free cash flow, while a firmer currency and disappointing Retail Sales data weighed on sentiment in Tokyo. Hang Seng (+0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.2%) were choppy on the trade uncertainties and following another net liquidity drain by the PBoC, although Chinese stocks later recovered amid pre-emptive measures in the face of a looming trade war including a further devaluation of the currency and adjustments of tariffs on some imports from other Asia-Pac nations. &nbsp;Finally, 10yr JGBs traded flat amid the indecisive risk tone and amid weaker demand at today&rsquo;s 2yr auction later, in which accepted prices also declined from prior.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade cautiously following the headwinds from Wall St where all major indices wiped out intraday gains, with trade uncertainties remaining in focus after White House economic adviser Kudlow rejected the perception that Trump was softening his stance on China. ASX 200 (+0.2%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.4%) are mixed with Australia kept afloat by commodity names as the energy sector outperforms on further gains in crude and with Santos underpinned after the board approved a new dividend policy which targets paying 10%-30% of free cash flow, while a firmer currency and disappointing Retail Sales data have weighed on sentiment in Tokyo. Hang Seng (Unch.) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) are choppy on the trade uncertainties and following another net liquidity drain by the PBoC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet with most majors taking a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s losses against the greenback which has kept the DXY above the 95.00 level, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD languish near the prior session&rsquo;s lows at the 1.1500 and 1.3100 handles respectively. Elsewhere, the cautious tone spurred mild flows into JPY in which USD/JPY tested 110.00 to the downside, while antipodeans are mixed as AUD attempts to nurse losses and with NZD softer after the RBNZ decision to keep rates unchanged as expected, in which it reiterated rates will remain at the current level for a considerable period and that the possibilities of a future hike or cut were evenly balanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs trade with very modest gains amid the cautious risk tone, with upside capped as participants look ahead to a 2yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
