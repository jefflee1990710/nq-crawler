BoE also voted 9-0 in favour of maintaining the current stock of UK government bond purchases and voted 9-0 in favour of maintaining the current stock of corporate bonds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Minutes:<br />BoE removed the line from the February release &lsquo;were the economy to evolve broadly in line with the February inflation report projections, monetary policy would need to be tightened somewhat earlier and by a somewhat greater extent over the forecast than anticipated at the time of the November report, in order to return inflation sustainably to target.&rsquo; The BoE also stated that data overall has been broadly consistent with the MPC&rsquo;s view set out in the QIR and that Inflation is expected to ease further in the short term but remain above the 2% target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said she is looking forward to an EU endorsed Brexit transition.

USD was lingering near lows, digesting the dovish aspects of the FOMC rate decision in early trade, though gradually pared back losses over the course of the session (but we haven&rsquo;t tested the pre-Fed highs) as Trade Wars newsflow hit, and key US policymakers talked-up protectionism. JPY strengthened on risk-aversion, with USDJPY flirting with fresh YTD lows &ndash; though couldn&rsquo;t print fresh lows beneath 105.23 &ndash; with the currency pair said to have been well-supported by corporate bids above 105.25. Risk FX (AUD, NZD, CAD) were hit by the risk-off news and USD strength, while commodities also weighed. CAD saw small weakness after a batch of dovish comments from BOC&rsquo;s Wilkins, with USDCAD rising back above 1.29. A hawkish BOE couldn&rsquo;t inspire hawkish price action, and the GBP is lower against the buck and the EUR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoC&rsquo;s Wilkins suggested there may be a case for taking more time to bring inflation back to target than the usual 6 to 8 quarters in some situations, while Wilkins added that there is a balance to be struck between moving too quickly or too slowly in hiking rates.

According to the reports, the US could seek to limit Chinese acquisitions in the US and will also challenge licensing practices at WTO. Furthermore, the US is to publish a list of products that could be targeted for tariffs within 15 days of signing the presidential memorandum, while a 30-day consultation period was also announced, and President Trump later commented that tariffs could amount up to USD 60bln.

The 100dma was a focus for Emini S&amp;P traders, with the index breaching the level going into the last leg of trade. US President Trump announced $50bln of annual tariffs on China over IP theft, as expected, which gave a slight lift to US equities. However, as China threatened to hit back at the US with retaliations, basic materials took a hit with steel and aluminium names (X, NUE, STLD) all took a leg lower. Utilities were positive for much of the session (the only green sector), as some defensive names caught a bid following trade war newsflow. SPX -2.53% at 2643, NDX -2.50% at 6682 and DJI -2.95% at 23955.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volume was heavier on Thursday than it was on Wednesday (when the Fed lifted rates). The curve flattened, with most of the action being seen in the belly, where yields on 10s breached 2.80%, the third time in March. However, at settlement, the 10 was above that level. The UST auctioned $11bln of 10-year TIPS, stopping-through the screens by 0.1bps, and cover above recent averages. T-notes settled 18 ticks higher at 120-16+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT:&nbsp;</strong>Stocks down, dollar up, Treasuries up, oil down.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW:&nbsp;</strong>Trump announces tariffs against China imports, BOE hawkish hold.<br /><strong>* AHEAD:</strong>&nbsp;Potential Senate omnibus vote, Japan CPI, China retaliation; Canada CPI/retail (Fri), Fed speakers (Bostic/Rosengren on Fri)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES:&nbsp;SPX -2.53% at 2643, NDX -2.50% at 6682 and DJI -2.95% at 23955</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): -1.99%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): -0.89%, ENERGY (XLE): -2.09%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -3.32%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): -2.90%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -3.30%, MATERIALS (XLB): -2.94%, TECH (XLK): -2.73%, TELECOMS (XTL): -1.33%, UTLITIES (XLU): +0.45%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* US equity futures are lower for a second day amid concerns about trade wars, and following on from yesterday&rsquo;s FOMC rate decision. The 100dma was a focus for Emini S&amp;P traders, with the index breaching the level going into the last leg of trade. US President Trump announced $50bln of annual tariffs on China over IP theft, as expected, which gave a slight lift to US equities. However, as China threatened to hit back at the US with retaliations, basic materials took a hit with steel and aluminium names (X, NUE, STLD) all took a leg lower. Utilities were positive for much of the session (the only green sector), as some defensive names caught a bid following trade war newsflow. After market, earnings from Nike (NKE), Micron (MU) and Cintas (CTAS) are due.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:&nbsp;</strong>Risk-off flows were dictating FX action.&nbsp;<strong>USD&nbsp;</strong>was lingering near lows, digesting the dovish aspects of the FOMC rate decision in early trade, though gradually pared back losses over the course of the session (but we haven&rsquo;t tested the pre-Fed highs) as Trade Wars newsflow hit, and key US policymakers talked-up protectionism.&nbsp;<strong>JPY</strong>&nbsp;strengthened on risk-aversion, with USDJPY flirting with fresh YTD lows &ndash; though couldn&rsquo;t print fresh lows beneath 105.23 &ndash; with the currency pair said to have been well-supported by corporate bids above 105.25. Risk FX (<strong>AUD, NZD, CAD</strong>) were hit by the risk-off news and USD strength, while commodities also weighed. CAD saw small weakness after a batch of dovish comments from BOC&rsquo;s Wilkins, with USDCAD rising back above 1.29. A hawkish BOE couldn&rsquo;t inspire hawkish price action, and the GBP is lower against the buck and the EUR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES:&nbsp;Settled 18 ticks higher at 120-16+</strong>. Volume was heavier on Thursday than it was on Wednesday (when the Fed lifted rates). The curve flattened, with most of the action being seen in the belly, where yields on 10s breached 2.80%, the third time in March. However, at settlement, the 10 was above that level. The UST auctioned $11bln of 10-year TIPS, stopping-through the screens by 0.1bps, and cover above recent averages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: WTI crude futures settle 87c lower at USD 64.30; Brent crude futures settle 56c lower at USD 68.91.&nbsp;</strong>Oil prices dipped on Thursday, with talk of profit-taking after the gains seen this week after the surprise draw in inventories reported. The USD strength seen as the session progressed was a headwind for crude, while traders also continued to cite tensions in the Middle East between Saudi Arabia and Iran (particularly, the spectre of the US potentially re-applying sanctions on Iran in May). Additionally, the stock slide also contributed to declines. Elsewhere, Russia&rsquo;s Finance minister said the country is ready for the end of the output cut deal, while Rosneft said it can raise output by 100k BPD three-months after the supply cut deal has ended. On a positive note, a note by Goldman Sachs received attention, with the bank seeing Brent prices rising to $82.50 by the middle of 2018.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:&nbsp;</strong>US announced $50bln tariffs (could be up to $60bln, Trump says) against China over intellectual property theft, under section &#39;301&#39;, meaning that the WTO can be circumvented. The US could seek to limit Chinese acquisitions in the US too, it said. Additionally, the US will challenge licensing practices at WTO US to publish within 15 days of signing presidential memorandum with a list of products that could be targeted for tariffs. The immediate reaction saw&nbsp;USD strengthen; EURUSD printed fresh session lows at 1.2285 while USDJPY rose off session lows towards the 105.60, level helping the DXY to retest this 90.00 level, US 10-Year T-Note Future slipped from 120-22 to 120-18. Elsewhere, the EU and several others have won temporary exemptions from steel/aluminium tariffs, allowing time for negotiations to continue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US SPENDING BILL:&nbsp;</strong>The US House passed a $1.3tln spending bill that takes steps toward avoiding a government shutdown on Friday. The omnibus bill now passes on to the Senate, where some reports suggests it may face obstacles. Despite potential obstacles, Senate minority leader Schumer is confident it will pass. Some suggest that the next round of voting could take place Thursday night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE:&nbsp;</strong>While it did not specifically say so, the BOE prepared markets for a May hike after two hawkish dissenters voted to lift the Bank Rate (McCafferty and Saunders again), while the minutes stated that other members are also considering hikes. But with that said, the reaction was dovish, and the implied pricing of a May hike slipped to around 60% (it was around 70% on Wednesday). That dovish reaction may have been a function of the meeting minutes where the BOE reiterated that the timing and extent of future policy adjustments would depend on the trade-off between supporting growth and containing inflation pressures, amid the Brexit uncertainty. Additionally, it may have been a function of the overall risk tone, where the fixed income complex was trading higher.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>JPY</strong>: Trade wars remain at the forefront of investors&rsquo; minds amid reports that Trump will announce China tariffs today (1230EDT) with the value said to be around USD 50bln (lower than the previously touted USD 60bln). Retaliation from China is likely, as evidenced by yesterday&rsquo;s WSJ report. Subsequently, the dampened risk appetite saw JPY gain across the board with USD/JPY hovering just above the 2018 low, (105.23) a breach of this could see a test of the 105 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP:&nbsp;</strong>Bank of England voted 7-2 to keep rates unchanged at 0.5%, Saunders and McCafferty the hawkish dissenters, which saw a knee-jerk reaction higher in GBP to briefly break above 1.42. However, the BoE refrained from confirming a rate hike is a done deal for May (current pricing at 60%), with much of the report largely in line with the February QIR. Interestingly, members did sight concerns over dampening effects of global protectionism. UK retail sales somewhat balanced with higher than expected readings for the February report met with downward revisions to January&rsquo;s figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong> back down to the low 1.23s after flash PMI&rsquo;s from Germany and France missed expectations across the board, alongside softer German IFO survey&rsquo;s amid growing uncertainty over protectionism alongside the appreciation in the EUR (also flagged in yesterday&rsquo;s ZEW survey). However, exemptions for the EU on US trade tariffs should ease concerns in the short-term, while longer term focus over the ECB&rsquo;s exit strategy keeps EUR in an uptrend. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Antipodeans: AUD and NZD</strong> weighed down by the risk aversion, more notably so in AUD after the softer jobs report overnight in which the headline employment change fell short of expectations (17.5 vs. Exp. 20k), while the unemployment rate saw an unexpected uptick. AUD/USD hovering around 0.77, while much of the downside in the Aussie has been seen against &nbsp;JPY, which now trades at the lowest level since Nov&rsquo;16.</p>\r\n",

Conversely, <strong>Hang Seng (-1.1%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%)</strong> underperformed with the US set to announce tariffs on China later today and after both the HKMA and PBoC raised rates in response to the Fed. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher by around 10ticks as they tracked the gains seen in T-notes which found relief from the unchanged 2018 Fed rate hike projections, while the BoJ were also in the market for JPY 710bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end with its Rinban amounts kept unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injects CNY 10bln via 7-day reverse repos in which it raised rates on 7-day reverse repo by 5bps to 2.55%. PBoC raises interest rate in standing facility by 5bps to 2.55%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC stated that the increase in reverse repo rates meets market expectations and is a normal response to the Fed rate hike, while the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also raised rates by 25bps to 2.00% in lockstep with the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3167 (Prev. 6.3396)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Employment Change (Feb) 17.5k vs. Exp. 20.0k (Prev. 16.0k, Rev. 12.5k).

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&rsquo;s Floden said sticking to the current interest rate path is the fastest way to get interest rates up adding that the latest inflation outcomes are clearly lower than expectations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US House and Senate leaders agreed to USD 1.3tln spending bill which they hope to pass prior to the government shutdown deadline at midnight this Friday, although there were also reports that US House Freedom Caucus said it is against the omnibus spending measure.

Equities then staged a mild recovery before once again taking another turn lower in what has been a choppy session of trade thus far since the open. In terms of sector specifics, all ten sectors trade lower with some modest outperformance in energy names in-fitting with price action in the complex as WTI held onto the USD 65/bbl level (has since lost this level). Individual movers include Reckitt Benckiser (+5.5%) who have confirmed they have dropped out of the running for Pfzier&rsquo;s consumer health business which has subsequently paved the way open for GSK (-1.0%) to make an approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>USD</strong>: Initially a choppy reaction from the FOMC&rsquo;s rate hike decision yesterday, however the greenback ultimately softened after members maintained 2018 rate path view of 3 rate hikes (1 member away from median projection at 4). Additionally, the central bank steepened the path of rate hikes for 2019-2020, however the council did soften language around activity. <strong>DXY</strong> trading above mid-89 with losses stemmed after finding support at the March lows of 89.40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade wars remain at the forefront of investors&rsquo; minds amid reports that Trump will announce China tariffs today (1230EDT) with the value said to be around USD 50bln (lower than the previously touted USD 60bln). Retaliation from China is likely, as evidenced by yesterday&rsquo;s WSJ report. Subsequently, the increased uncertainty could take USD/JPY back down to the 2018 low (105.23) prompting a test of the 105 handle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antipodeans (<strong>AUD</strong>,<strong>NZD</strong>): RBNZ kept interest rates unchanged at 1.75%, as expected. Market pricing for a rate hike is not seen until mid-19. As such, <strong>NZD</strong> saw a muted reaction upon release, the central bank struck a rather balanced tone after remaining upbeat over global growth, but highlighted downside risks to inflation. <strong>NZD</strong> currently trading in a tight 40pip with price action likely to be driven by risk. A firm break above 0.7260 could see the spot price back at 0.7350, however, trade war uncertainty may see gains tempered. Elsewhere, <strong>AUD</strong> has been pressured by the jobs report overnight with the headline employment change falling short of expectations (17.5 vs. Exp. 20k), while the unemployment rate saw an unexpected uptick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EUR</strong>,<strong>GBP</strong>: EUR dipping slightly with flash PMI&rsquo;s from Germany and France missing expectations across the board taking the currency down to the middle of the 1.2340-90 range. A strong IFO report needed for <strong>EUR</strong> to see 1.24. GBP currently trading at the highest level in almost two months, 1.42 now insight with eyes on whether the BoE will signal a May hike (current pricing at 56%).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fixed income markets, German paper initially benefitted from the fallout of yesterday&rsquo;s FOMC release with the softness in equities also giving <strong>Bunds</strong> a helping hand as the German 10yr benchmark eyes 158.50 to the upside. Furthermore, data has also provided support this morning after French, German and EZ PMI figures missed across the board, whilst German IFO survey data came in mixed. Further direction is likely to emanate from the US entrance to market or any price action in Gilts post-BoE if the MPC opt to lay the groundwork for a May hike. Elsewhere for UK paper, largely better than expected UK retail sales (downward revisions to the priors) failed to sway price action. Finally, some are paying notice to large month-end extensions in <strong>Gilts</strong> of 0.22 amid the fallout of the 4.25% 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the commodities complex, <strong>WTI</strong> (-0.8%) and <strong>Brent</strong> <strong>Crude</strong> (-0.6%) are taking a breather from yesterday&rsquo;s post-DOE rally with both benchmarks hovering just below their highest level since early February amid rising concerns of US output threatening to disrupt the tightening market; WTI has recently given back the USD 65/bbl handle. Moving onto metals, despite a softer USD and general risk-aversion thus far, gold prices are seen modestly lower after <strong>spot</strong> <strong>gold</strong> hit highs of USD 1334.8/oz overnight. Elsewhere in base metals, <strong>copper</strong> climbed off its lowest level in three months, <strong>Dalian</strong> <strong>iron</strong> <strong>ore</strong> rose 0.9% after recouping recent losses, <strong>steel</strong> futures were seen lower overnight as demand concerns continue to hamper sentiment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Ultimately, however, the net result was that the Emini, mini Dow and mini Nasdaq ended the press conference around the levels that it entered the rate decision, as traders struggle to digest the exact meaning from the FOMC. Equity traders seem to have settled on the narrative that conditions will remain accommodative, and the normalisation process will be gradual. Financials performed well as the FOMC rate path projection rose from 5 to 6 hikes through 2019 due to their sensitivity to interest rates. Away from the Fed, energy led gains after a bullish DOE report buoyed the sector. Consumer staples underperformed today being led by General Mills (GIS) following weak FY guidance in its earnings report, which also weighed on competitors like Kellogg&rsquo;s (K), Conagra Brands (CAG) and JM Smucker (SJM); with the 4 companies closing the day as some of the largest underperformers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.2%) </strong>and<strong> Nikkei 225 (+0.8%)</strong> were varied with commodity-related stocks underpinned by gains in crude and the metals complex due to a softer USD, while the <strong>KOSPI (+0.3%)</strong> also gained amid US tariff exemption hopes after US Trade Representative Lighthizer named South Korea as one of the countries likely to be exempted. Conversely, <strong>Hang Seng (-0.3%) </strong>and<strong> Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) underperformed</strong> with the US set to announce tariffs on China later today and after both the HKMA and PBoC raised rates in response to the Fed. Finally, 10yr JGBs were higher by around 10ticks as they tracked the gains seen in T-notes which found relief from the unchanged 2018 Fed rate hike projections, while the BoJ were also in the market for JPY 710bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end with its Rinban amounts kept unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injects CNY 10bln via 7-day reverse repos in which it raised rates on 7-day reverse repo by 5bps to 2.55%. (Newswires)<br />PBoC stated that the increase in reverse repo rates meets market expectations and is a normal response to the Fed rate hike, while the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also raised rates by 25bps to 2.00% in lockstep with the Fed.<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.3167 (Prev. 6.3396)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU leaders are to remind UK that nothing is agreed yet on Brexit and noted respect is needed with commitments to Ireland and Gibraltar.

Elsewhere, antipodeans traded mixed as <strong>AUD</strong> pulled back following a miss on jobs data, and <strong>NZD</strong> held onto post-FOMC gains after the RBNZ rate decision provided no surprises. <strong>HKD</strong> woes also continued overnight in which the currency briefly posted a fresh 33yr low against the greenback despite the HKMA raising its base rate by 25bps in lockstep with the Fed, while the HKMA also signalled it would intervene and buy HKD if it reaches the lower end of the trading band at 7.85 against USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBNZ kept the Official Cash Rate at 1.75% vs. Exp. 1.75% (Prev. 1.75%) and reiterated that monetary policy will remain accommodative for a considerable period,</strong> while it also noted that numerous uncertainties that remain and monetary policy may need to adjust accordingly. RBNZ further commented that economic growth is expected to strengthen and noted that inflation expectations remain well anchored at around 2%, but added that CPI is set to weaken in near term (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadian PM Trudeau said a successful NAFTA deal is likely, while there were also comments from Canada&rsquo;s Unifor union head that US NAFTA negotiators have dropped demand for 50% US content in vehicles produced in member nations.

Elsewhere, gold saw some mild profit taking, while copper extended on the gains seen following the FOMC which had weakened the greenback and lifted prices across the complex in reaction to the unchanged 2018 rate hike projections.<br /><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries endured a rollercoaster ride through the FOMC today ultimately however there was little by way of new information and while 2s5s saw a knee jerk steepening the steepness pared back through the course of the press conference settling the day relatively unchanged at 61bp. 5s30s did see some knee jerk flattening but like other major curve spreads moves were pared back leave the 5s30s spread unchanged for the session at 159bp. 10year T-notes settled down 4+ ticks at 119-30+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US President Trump plans to announce China tariffs today with the value of the tariffs likely around USD 50bln per year or slightly less, according to sources</strong>.

ASX 200 (-0.2%) is subdued and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) is higher with commodity-related stocks underpinned by gains in crude and the metals complex due to a softer USD, while the KOSPI (+0.5%) also gained amid tariff exemption hopes after US Trade Representative Lighthizer named South Korea as one of the countries likely to be exempted from US tariffs. Hang Seng (-0.4%) and Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) underperform ahead of the announcement of US tariffs on China later today and after both the HKMA and PBoC raised rates in response to the Fed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, USD remains weaker in the wake of the FOMC where projections for 3 hike this year were maintained, which in turn boosted EUR/USD and GBP/USD firmly above the 1.2300 and 1.4100 levels respectively. Elsewhere, JPY is firmer with USD/JPY back below 106.00 and antipodeans are mixed, with AUD mildly pulling back after a miss on jobs data while NZD holds onto gains after the RBNZ rate decision provided no surprises. HKD woes continued and briefly posted a fresh 33yr low against the greenback despite the HKMA raising its base rate by 25bps in lockstep with the Fed, while the HKMA also signalled it would intervene and buy HKD if it reaches the lower end of the trading band at 7.85 against USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are higher as they track the gains seen in T-notes which found relief from the unchanged 2018 Fed rate hike projections, while the BoJ were also in the market for JPY 710bln of JGBs in the belly to super-long end and with its Rinban amounts kept unchanged.</p>\r\n",
