(Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Saudi Arabia expect a substantial oil stock draw in the second half of the year according to a statement, which added that oil exports are to fall 100k bpd in August and talk of oil market over-supply is baseless. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICAL</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump said he is much tougher on Russia than past presidents and that getting along with Russia is positive, while he added he will be Putin&#39;s worst enemy if relationship doesn&#39;t work out.

Trump added that rate hikes might put the US at a disadvantage since European and Japanese policy remains loose but emphasised that these were his own views. (CNBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House spokesperson later said that US President Trump respects the independence of the Fed and that Trump is not interfering with Fed decisions, while the White House also noted that Trump&rsquo;s views are well known and that those comments today are reiterations of long held positions.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of M&amp;A, following Wednesday&rsquo;s news that Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) and Wendy&rsquo;s (WEN) had held merger talks prior to the PZZA CEO stepping down, CNBC reported talks were not currently occurring. Comcast (CMCSA) announced it is not going to acquire Fox (FOXA) assets and instead focus on Sky (SKY LN). This was then followed by Disney (DIS) announcing that it is not going to increase its offer for Sky, and will focus on Fox&rsquo;s assets. Elsewhere, Tribune (TRCO) and Sinclair (SBGI) were lower after the FCC unanimously voted to send the deal between the two to a hearing to determine if SBGI misrepresented or omitted material facts in the TRCO application. American Express (AXP) were lower following a small miss on revenue and higher expenses, which were up 7% y/y. IBM (IBM) had their best day since last October following a beat on both top and bottom line. eBay (EBAY) were hit as they missed on revenue expectations and also lowered their FY18 revenue forecasts, however it raised EPS forecast and also beat on EPS. Philip Morris (PM) beat on both top and bottom lines, however, lowered FY18 EPS forecast beneath expectations, which also hit Altria (MO). Another name of note is Danaher (DHR) whose earnings led to the name reaching a new record high after beating on both ends and increasing its FY18 adjusted EPS views, as well as announcing a spin off its dental&nbsp; business into its own public traded company, which is to be tax free to shareholders. Elsewhere, AbbVie (ABBV) was lower as Citron Research named it the next great drug short, Freeport McMoran (FCX) was lower following falling copper prices, and reports that a deal is near with the Indonesian government, where it would give up its majority stake in Grasberg to the Indonesian government, which reports suggest shareholders are unhappy about, since they believe &ldquo;money had been left on the table&rdquo;; however this deal is not finalised. Metal names were lower following poor earnings report from Alcoa (AA) who cut its FY18 adj. EBITDA forecast due to tariffs. Nucor (NUE) however reported a strong earnings report but closed in the red amid trade concerns.<br />SPX -0.41% at 2804, NDX -0.51% at 7352, DJI -0.55% at 25060.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries hit session highs after Trump expressed opposition over interest rate hikes, sending the 2s10s spread to 25.10bps, 3bps narrower at one point. The US also auctioned $13bln of 10-year TIPS in a fairly lacklustre auction, which saw a tail of 1.5bps; cover was softer too, and analysts said that the auction demonstrates that there weren&rsquo;t any significant inflationary fears, else they may have been seen in the auction results. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 7+&nbsp; ticks higher at 120-09+.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities down, Treasuries up, crude mixed, dollar flat.<br />* REAR-VIEW: Trump talks down USD, says rate hikes will disadvantage the US; Jobless Claims hit 49-year low; EU-US trade tensions; UK Retail Sales miss, Philly Fed Business Index beat.<br />* COMING-UP: Thursday AMC earnings: MSFT, ISRG, CTAS; Friday BMO earnings GE, HON, BHGE, SLB, HO FP // Canadian CPI &amp; Retail Sales; Fed&#39;s Bullard, BoE&rsquo;s Tenreyro, ECB&rsquo;s Coeure; weekly rig count; Fitch on France.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRUMP ON USD, RATES: </strong>US President Donald Trump said he was not happy about interest rates rising, in an interview with CNBC. Trump did, however, say that Fed chair Powell was a good man, and letting the Fed do what it feels was best, though he did add that rate hikes may disadvantage the US, given the looseness of ECB and BOJ policy. On the dollar, the US President said that its high value was putting the US at a disadvantage, while China&rsquo;s yuan was &ldquo;dropping like a rock.&rdquo; Trump stressed that this was his own opinion. White House Spokeperson said US President Trump respects the independence of the Fed, Trump is not interfering with Fed decisions, helping the USD to pare back some of the Trump-induced weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>Commerce Secretary Ross noted positive developments in trade talks, but believes it is too early to say if the probe results on national security ruling, emphasizing the auto industry is vital to US and global economies. China Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman responding to comments by NEC Director Kudlow, said accusations that President Xi was stalling trade talks were &ldquo;shocking&rdquo; and &ldquo;bogus&rdquo;. In Europe, the EU is mulling tariffs on imports of US coal, pharmaceuticals and chemistry goods in retaliation to the US.&nbsp; EU trade rep Malmstroem argued the removal of auto tariffs with the US could only be done as part of a broader trade deal, reiterating that the EU is preparing list of re-balancing measures in case US imposes 20% tariffs on cars if the US implements trade barriers. Elsewhere, France is looking to strengthen anti-takeover measures on the back of a foreign investment surge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JOBLESS CLAIMS: </strong>Claims hit a 49-year low, coming in at 207K and missing expectations at 220K, with analysts attributing the fall to seasonal factors, such as July 4th holiday and automakers&rsquo; annual retooling shutdowns. Pantheon expects claims to rebound back towards the 220k level in the upcoming weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PHILLY FED INDEX: </strong>The index posted at 25.7, beating expectations at 21.5, rising from the previous 19.9. New Orders jumped to 31.4 from previous 17.9, Prices Paid leaped to 69.2 from 51.8, the highest since July 2008 mainly on the back of higher oil prices. On the flip side, Employment plunged to 16.8 from 30.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8, EXPIRES FRIDAY) SETTLES $0.70 HIGHER AT $69.46; WTI (U8) SETTLES $0.49 HIGHER AT USD 62.24; BRENT (U8) SETTLES $0.32 LOWER AT $72.58.</strong> Saudi Arabia expect a substantial oil stock draw down in the second half of the year, according to a statement. Oil exports are to fall 100k bpd in August, and are expected to be flat in July. The Saudis also added that talk of oil market over-supply is baseless. &ldquo;While we&rsquo;re certainly see the market respond in bullish fashion to the talk backed up by a reduction in exports, we do note that the subtext is less supportive,&rdquo; Citi said. &ldquo;Saudi Arabia is actually putting a bullish spin on the fact that its clients don&rsquo;t need more oil for August, and this is actually far more consistent with the idea that the Q3 market is closely balanced than the ongoing deficit the market is trying to sell the market on today.&rdquo; Citi adds that we are also seeing some short covering in the August WTI contract ahead of Friday&rsquo;s contract expiration, &ldquo;possibly more directly tied to the remaining order balance than any particular fundamental pressure.&rdquo; In Norway, almost 1600 oil workers have reached a deal to end industrial action, according to the Shipowners&rsquo; Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX&nbsp; -0.41% at 2804, NDX -0.51% at 7352, DJI -0.55% at 25060. </strong>SECTORS: Energy: -0.03%, Materials: -0.64%, Industrials: -0.05%, Cons Discretionary: -0.22%, Cons Staples: -0.15%, Health Care: -0.57%, Financials: -1.46%, Tech: -0.40%, Telecoms: -1.12%, Utilities: +0.96%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*M&amp;A: </strong>Following Wednesday&rsquo;s news that Papa John&rsquo;s (PZZA) and Wendy&rsquo;s (WEN) had held merger talks prior to the PZZA CEO stepping down, CNBC reported talks were not currently occurring. Comcast (CMCSA) announced it is not going to acquire Fox (FOXA) assets and instead focus on Sky (SKY LN). This was then followed by Disney (DIS) announcing that it is not going to increase its offer for Sky, and will focus on Fox&rsquo;s assets. Elsewhere, Tribune (TRCO) and Sinclair (SBGI) were lower after the FCC unanimously voted to send the deal between the two to a hearing to determine if SBGI misrepresented or omitted material facts in the TRCO application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EARNINGS: </strong>American Express (AXP) were lower following a small miss on revenue and higher expenses, which were up 7% y/y. IBM (IBM) had their best day since last October following a beat on both top and bottom line. eBay (EBAY) were hit as they missed on revenue expectations and also lowered their FY18 revenue forecasts, however it raised EPS forecast and also beat on EPS. Philip Morris (PM) beat on both top and bottom lines, however, lowered FY18 EPS forecast beneath expectations, which also hit Altria (MO). Another name of note is Danaher (DHR) whose earnings led to the name reaching a new record high after beating on both ends and increasing its FY18 adjusted EPS views, as well as announcing a spin off its dental&nbsp; business into its own public traded company, which is to be tax free to shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>AbbVie (ABBV) was lower as Citron Research named it the next great drug short, Freeport McMoran (FCX) was lower following falling copper prices, and reports that a deal is near with the Indonesian government, where it would give up its majority stake in Grasberg to the Indonesian government, which reports suggest shareholders are unhappy about, since they believe &ldquo;money had been left on the table&rdquo;; however this deal is not finalised. Metal names were lower following poor earnings report from Alcoa (AA) who cut its FY18 adj. EBITDA forecast due to tariffs. Nucor (NUE) however reported a strong earnings report but closed in the red amid trade concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 7+&nbsp; TICKS HIGHER AT 120-09+. </strong>Treasuries hit session highs after Trump expressed opposition over interest rate hikes, sending the 2s10s spread to 25.10bps, 3bps narrower at one point. The US also auctioned $13bln of 10-year TIPS in a fairly lacklustre auction, which saw a tail of 1.5bps; cover was softer too, and analysts said that the auction demonstrates that there weren&rsquo;t any significant inflationary fears, else they may have been seen in the auction results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The USD gave up early gains (we did see a fresh YTD high for the DXY at 95.656) after US President Trump once again renewed his criticism of its high value, and made the case that higher US interest rates puts America at a disadvantage, given that ECB and BOJ policy remains loose. Later, the buck pared back some of the Trump-induced losses after the White House stated that the Administration respects the Fed&rsquo;s independence. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD: </strong>Extending losses vs their US peer and both on the precipice of key support levels that could lead to even more pronounced declines, like the CNY and CNH that are increasingly looking devalued rather than weak (both Yuans nearing 6.8000 vs the USD). The Kiwi is now in danger of freefall through 0.6700 and AUD prone to retesting its low for the year so far at 0.7310 that would expose big barriers at 0.7300, with the near 0.7450 Aussie labour data peak seemingly ever more distant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CAD: </strong>Another victim of Greenback strength and USDCAD through 1.3250 at worst, but the Loonie deriving some support from another rebound crude that offset a drop in Canadian ADP jobs, as well as Trump&rsquo;s USD comments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>Downed by a big UK retail sales miss, hot on the heels of Wednesday&rsquo;s benign inflation data, but also persistent Brexit and related Government jitters, with Cable losing 1.3000 and registering a 2nd consecutive 2018 low around 1.2960, while EURGBP climbed over 0.8940. GBP recovered the 1.30 level after Trump&rsquo;s comments on the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CHF, EUR: </strong>Both around lower vs the USD and crossing psychological levels around par and 1.1600 respectively, with the single currency briefly through start of July support to test, but not break a Fib at 1.1575 and perhaps also drawn back up towards 1.1595-1.1600 option expiries for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY: </strong>Bucking the broad losing trend vs the USD as the headline pair retreated from another 113.00+ foray and remained capped ahead of technical resistance and the previous 2018 high (113.39) seen way back in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>More pain for EMs and losses ranging from 0.5-1.5% vs the Buck, and the Rand only paring some downside after the SARB noted upside inflation risks and indicated it would be swift to respond if 2nd round effects manifested. USDZAR now around 13.4500 vs 13.5100 at the session high.</p>\r\n",

The Kiwi is now in danger of freefall through 0.6700 and Aud prone to retesting its low for the year so far at 0.7310 that would expose big barriers at 0.7300, with the near 0.7450 Aussie labour data peak seemingly ever more distant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downed by a big UK retail sales miss, hot on the heels of Wednesday&rsquo;s benign inflation data, but also persistent Brexit and related Government jitters, with Cable losing 1.3000 and registering a 2nd consecutive 2018 low around 1.2960, while Eur/Gbp climbed over 0.8940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another victim of Greenback strength and down through 1.3250 at worst, but the Loonie deriving some support from another rebound crude that offset a drop in Canadian ADP jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both around 0.3% lower vs the Usd and crossing psychological levels around par and 1.1600 respectively, with the single currency briefly through start of July support to test, but not break a Fib at 1.1575 and perhaps also drawn back up towards 1.1595-1.1600 option expiries for the NY cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bucking the broad losing trend vs the Usd as the headline pair retreated from another 113.00+ foray and remained capped ahead of technical resistance and the previous 2018 high (113.39) seen way back in January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, more pain for EMs and losses ranging from 0.5-1.5% vs the Buck, and the Rand only paring some downside after the SARB noted upside inflation risks and indicated it would be swift to respond if 2nd round effects manifested. Usd/Zar now around 13.4500 vs 13.5100 at the session high.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) both opened higher with outperformance in industrials and mining related sectors, while corporate updates also spurred trade. Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) initially gained after further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and with the central bank mulling incentives to bolster lending. However, gains were capped amid the ongoing US-China trade friction including recent comments from NEC Director Kudlow who believes President Xi Jinping is &#39;holding up&#39; progress on trade talks and is doubtful on the Chinese leader&rsquo;s intention of following through on trade reforms, while concerns triggered by considerable CNH weakness pushed Chinese bourses past the tipping point and in turn pared gains in Japan. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices flat for most the session although some support was seen in late trade as Japanese stocks wiped out gains, while a reduction in the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban purchases of 10yr-25yr and 25yr+ bonds also failed to spur any reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 70bln, while the PBoC was also reported to gauged 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility demand for today. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7066 (Prev. 6.6914)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC is said to mull incentives to improve liquidity in banks, as well as help expand lending and bond investments, while PBoC is also reported to be using its MLF to bolster lending activity among banks.

(CBS News/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also reports that the White House sees a lot of progress on trade talks with Mexico but is continuing both NAFTA tracks including with Canada. (Axios/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said it is technically possible to reach a NAFTA deal before the next Mexican government takes office on December 1st and that they are still seeking a three country NAFTA deal. Guajado added that he hopes to be in position to sign a deal by the end of November and hopes for an agreement in principal to be announced by the end of August, while he reiterated moving from NAFTA to a bilateral trade agreement with the US would be costly and effectively be similar to starting from scratch. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US began section 232 investigation on uranium imports, while there had been earlier comments from Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland that Canada&#39;s Uranium is not a threat to US security. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK International Trade Secretary Fox has warned the European Union that member states will face stark economic consequences if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal next year.

(WiWo) While the European Trade Commissioner Malmstroem said the removal of car tariffs with the US could only be done as part of a broader trade deal; adding the EU is preparing list of re-balancing measures in case US imposes tariffs on EU cars. She did also state the EU is not going to the US to negotiate trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mostly on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.2%) after initially trading choppy as earning season kicks into gear. UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 outperforms its peers on the back of currency effects amid weak UK retail sales. Energy names outperform, in-fitting with price action in WTI and Brent yesterday, while material names are subdued by the fall in base metals prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned, earnings dominated the morning with the likes of Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever (+0.5%) being a key focus. French advertising group Publicis (-7.2%) fell to the foot of the French benchmark after missing expectations, dragging down FTSE 100 listed WPP (-3.2%) in sympathy. On the flip side, Shell (+1.4%) shares rose to the top of the index after a broker upgrade at Raymond James.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index looks on the brink if not braced to test 95.531 ytd peaks after another upbeat rendition of the Fed&rsquo;s semi-annual testimony from Chair Powell, and as rival currencies continue to underperform on yield divergence alongside ramped up global trade war manoeuvres. As the import tariff spat between the US and China rages on, the YUAN has waned further to 6.7700+ in Cny terms and not far from 6.8000 on an off-shore basis (Cnh), which is viewed by some as the line in the sand for &lsquo;official&rsquo; intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi has lost most ground vs a broadly strong Usd, and the 0.6800 handle that was briefly reclaimed overnight on the coattails of a strong Aud rebound above 0.7400 and just shy of 0.7450 after a stellar Aussie jobs report (headline number blitzed consensus, and mainly due to a 40k+ jump in full-time workers). However, the antipodeans have recoiled to circa 0.6750 and 0.7360, with 2018 lows in sight again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Flogged anew after another UK data miss, as the warm weather and World cup boosted the sales of BBQ fodder, but hit non-food items and resulted in a negative overall m/m figure, on top of yesterday&rsquo;s softer than forecast CPI. Cable slumped through 1.3000 having breached daily support (1.3055) earlier to a fresh ytd base around 1.2985, but has regained big figure status amidst short covering and almost certainly with a mega 2 bn option expiry at the strike in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR/JPY - All casualties of the resurgent Greenback, and also eyeing round numbers close to key chart levels and/or lows for the year. The Loonie is locked around 1.3200 even though there has been some positive talk around US-Canadian-NAFTA negotiations, with another dump in oil prices perhaps offsetting, while the Franc is back down around parity and single currency pivoting around 1.1600. To recap, 1.1591 is the July low to date. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy is a fraction above 113.00, with the most recent high around 113.13, a MA at 113.29 and the previous 2018 peak at 113.39.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The rationale is well documented, so suffice to say that EMs are suffering more vs the Usd, with the Rand looking for some potential support from the SARB later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Gilts led a rebound in core EU bonds on the back of another UK data miss and the 10 year benchmark fleetingly climbed just over par to 123.70, while Bunds revisited their earlier marginally higher Eurex peak at 162.91.

ASX 200 (+0.3%) and Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) both opened higher with outperformance in industrials and mining related sectors, while corporate updates also spurred trade. Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) and Hang Seng (-0.4%) initially gained after further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and with the central bank mulling incentives to bolster lending. However, gains were capped amid the ongoing US-China trade friction including recent comments from NEC Director Kudlow who believes President Xi Jinping is &#39;holding up&#39; progress on trade talks and is doubtful on the Chinese leader&rsquo;s intention of following through on trade reforms, while concerns triggered by considerable CNH weakness pushed Chinese bourses past the tipping point and in turn pared gains in Japan. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices flat for most the session although some support was seen in late trade as Japanese stocks wiped out gains, while a reduction in the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban purchases of 10yr-25yr and 25yr+ bonds also failed to spur any reaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day reverse repos and CNY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos, for a net daily injection of CNY 70bln, while the PBoC was also reported to gauged 1yr Medium-term Lending Facility demand for today. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.7066 (Prev. 6.6914)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC is said to mull incentives to improve liquidity in banks, as well as help expand lending and bond investments, while PBoC is also reported to be using its MLF to bolster lending activity among banks.

(CBS News/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also reports that the White House sees a lot of progress on trade talks with Mexico but is continuing both NAFTA tracks including with Canada. (Axios/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said it is technically possible to reach a NAFTA deal before the next Mexican government takes office on December 1st and that they are still seeking a three country NAFTA deal. Guajado added that he hopes to be in position to sign a deal by the end of November and hopes for an agreement in principal to be announced by the end of August, while he reiterated moving from NAFTA to a bilateral trade agreement with the US would be costly and effectively be similar to starting from scratch. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US began section 232 investigation on uranium imports, while there had been earlier comments from Canadian Foreign Minister Freeland that Canada&#39;s Uranium is not a threat to US security. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK International Trade Secretary Fox has warned the European Union that member states will face stark economic consequences if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal next year.

(WiWo) While the European Trade Commissioner Malmstroem said the removal of car tariffs with the US could only be done as part of a broader trade deal; adding the EU is preparing list of re-balancing measures in case US imposes tariffs on EU cars. She did also state the EU is not going to the US to negotiate trade. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities trade mostly on the backfoot (Eurostoxx 50 -0.2%) after initially trading choppy as earning season kicks into gear. UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 outperforms its peers on the back of currency effects amid weak UK retail sales. Energy names outperform, in-fitting with price action in WTI and Brent yesterday, while material names are subdued by the fall in base metals prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned, earnings dominated the morning with the likes of Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever (+0.5%) being a key focus. French advertising group Publicis (-7.2%) fell to the foot of the French benchmark after missing expectations, dragging down FTSE 100 listed WPP (-3.2%) in sympathy. On the flip side, Shell (+1.4%) shares rose to the top of the index after a broker upgrade at Raymond James.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index looks on the brink if not braced to test 95.531 ytd peaks after another upbeat rendition of the Fed&rsquo;s semi-annual testimony from Chair Powell, and as rival currencies continue to underperform on yield divergence alongside ramped up global trade war manoeuvres. As the import tariff spat between the US and China rages on, the YUAN has waned further to 6.7700+ in Cny terms and not far from 6.8000 on an off-shore basis (Cnh), which is viewed by some as the line in the sand for &lsquo;official&rsquo; intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi has lost most ground vs a broadly strong Usd, and the 0.6800 handle that was briefly reclaimed overnight on the coattails of a strong Aud rebound above 0.7400 and just shy of 0.7450 after a stellar Aussie jobs report (headline number blitzed consensus, and mainly due to a 40k+ jump in full-time workers). However, the antipodeans have recoiled to circa 0.6750 and 0.7360, with 2018 lows in sight again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Flogged anew after another UK data miss, as the warm weather and World cup boosted the sales of BBQ fodder, but hit non-food items and resulted in a negative overall m/m figure, on top of yesterday&rsquo;s softer than forecast CPI. Cable slumped through 1.3000 having breached daily support (1.3055) earlier to a fresh ytd base around 1.2985, but has regained big figure status amidst short covering and almost certainly with a mega 2 bn option expiry at the strike in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR/JPY - All casualties of the resurgent Greenback, and also eyeing round numbers close to key chart levels and/or lows for the year. The Loonie is locked around 1.3200 even though there has been some positive talk around US-Canadian-NAFTA negotiations, with another dump in oil prices perhaps offsetting, while the Franc is back down around parity and single currency pivoting around 1.1600. To recap, 1.1591 is the July low to date. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy is a fraction above 113.00, with the most recent high around 113.13, a MA at 113.29 and the previous 2018 peak at 113.39.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The rationale is well documented, so suffice to say that EMs are suffering more vs the Usd, with the Rand looking for some potential support from the SARB later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Gilts led a rebound in core EU bonds on the back of another UK data miss and the 10 year benchmark fleetingly climbed just over par to 123.70, while Bunds revisited their earlier marginally higher Eurex peak at 162.91. However, both are back in negative territory with retail sales notoriously erratic and interestingly odds on an August rate hike from the BoE not materially low circa 68%. Note also, UK debt has supply to digest via 2057 paper. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain on the back foot after some relatively heavy downside price action during the overnight session and the curve steeper post-Powell 2 and pre-weekly claims, Philly Fed, LEI and $13 bn 10 year TIPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures have seen a pullback in European trade from the highs reached yesterday.

UK&rsquo;s FTSE 100 outperforms its peers on the back of currency effects amid weak UK retail sales. Energy names outperform, in-fitting with price action in WTI and Brent yesterday, while material names are subdued by the fall in base metals prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned, earnings dominated the morning with the likes of Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever (+0.5%) being a key focus. French advertising group Publicis (-7.2%) fell to the foot of the French benchmark after missing expectations, dragging down FTSE 100 listed WPP (-3.2%) in sympathy. On the flip side, Shell (+1.4%) shares rose to the top of the index after a broker upgrade at Raymond James.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index looks on the brink if not braced to test 95.531 ytd peaks after another upbeat rendition of the Fed&rsquo;s semi-annual testimony from Chair Powell, and as rival currencies continue to underperform on yield divergence alongside ramped up global trade war manoeuvres. As the import tariff spat between the US and China rages on, the YUAN has waned further to 6.7700+ in Cny terms and not far from 6.8000 on an off-shore basis (Cnh), which is viewed by some as the line in the sand for &lsquo;official&rsquo; intervention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi has lost most ground vs a broadly strong Usd, and the 0.6800 handle that was briefly reclaimed overnight on the coattails of a strong Aud rebound above 0.7400 and just shy of 0.7450 after a stellar Aussie jobs report (headline number blitzed consensus, and mainly due to a 40k+ jump in full-time workers). However, the antipodeans have recoiled to circa 0.6750 and 0.7360, with 2018 lows in sight again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Flogged anew after another UK data miss, as the warm weather and World cup boosted the sales of BBQ fodder, but hit non-food items and resulted in a negative overall m/m figure, on top of yesterday&rsquo;s softer than forecast CPI. Cable slumped through 1.3000 having breached daily support (1.3055) earlier to a fresh ytd base around 1.2985, but has regained big figure status amidst short covering and almost certainly with a mega 2 bn option expiry at the strike in mind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/EUR/JPY - All casualties of the resurgent Greenback, and also eyeing round numbers close to key chart levels and/or lows for the year. The Loonie is locked around 1.3200 even though there has been some positive talk around US-Canadian-NAFTA negotiations, with another dump in oil prices perhaps offsetting, while the Franc is back down around parity and single currency hovering just above 1.1600. To recap, 1.1591 is the July low to date. Meanwhile, Usd/Jpy is poised just under 113.00, with the most recent high around 113.13, a MA at 113.29 and the previous 2018 peak at 113.39.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM - The rationale is well documented, so suffice to say that EMs are suffering more vs the Usd, with the Rand looking for some potential support from the SARB later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Gilts led a rebound in core EU bonds on the back of another UK data miss and the 10 year benchmark fleetingly climbed just over par to 123.70, while Bunds revisited their earlier marginally higher Eurex peak at 162.91. However, both are back in negative territory with retail sales notoriously erratic and interestingly odds on an August rate hike from the BoE not materially low circa 68%. Note also, UK debt has supply to digest via 2057 paper. Elsewhere, US Treasuries remain on the back foot after some relatively heavy downside price action during the overnight session and the curve steeper post-Powell 2 and pre-weekly claims, Philly Fed, LEI and $13 bn 10 year TIPs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures have seen a pullback in European trade from the highs reached yesterday. Gains yesterday were largely fuelled by a covering of shorts post-DoEs, which despite revealing record US production, was accompanied by Cushing stockpiles falling to their lowest levels since 2014. Since then, energy newsflow has remained light with some traders mindful of supply disruptions amid reports that Yemeni rebels struck a Riyadh refinery, causing a fire; Aramco said, however, that operations were not impacted and that the fire was due to an operational incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, spot gold and silver sit at 1-year lows as the precious metals continue to fall victim to the firmer USD. Copper mirrored the lacklustre tone across most of the commodities complex during the Asia-Pac session as trade tensions lingered and CNH weakness clouded risk sentiment, whilst steel rebar futures hit their highest level in 10 months in Shanghai amid supply concerns. In terms of metals newsflow, Anglo American reported a 6% Y/Y increase in Q2 output whilst upgrading platinum production guidance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (Unch.) both opened higher with outperformance in industrials and mining related sectors, while corporate updates also spurred trade. Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) and Hang Seng (Unch.) initially gained after further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and with the central bank mulling incentives to bolster lending. However, gains were capped amid the ongoing US-China trade friction including recent comments from NEC Director Kudlow who believes President Xi Jinping is &#39;holding up&#39; progress on trade talks and is doubtful on the Chinese leader&rsquo;s intention of following through on trade reforms, while concerns triggered by considerable CNH weakness pushed Chinese bourses past the tipping point and in turn pared gains in Japan.

Trade in the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts also left much to be desired with EUR/USD and GBP/USD little changed but well off recent lows, especially for GBP/USD after reports EU negotiators are considering extending Article 50 which provided the pair with some relief from PM May&rsquo;s ongoing Brexit headache and recent CPI data. Elsewhere, AUD outperformed following a stellar jobs reports in which Employment Change surpassed forecasts at 50.9k vs. Exp. 17.0k which was predominantly fuelled by Full-Time jobs, while CNH was heavily pressured following the currency fix in which the PBoC weakened the reference rate beyond the psychological 6.7000 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Employment Change (Jun) 50.9k vs. Exp. 17.0k (Prev. 12.0k, Rev. 13.5k).

Gold prices were also range-bound and failed to take advantage of the recent pullback in the greenback, while copper mirrored the lacklustre tone across most the commodities complex as trade tensions and lingered and CNH weakness clouded risk sentiment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC+ members are to hold monthly meetings to monitor the oil market, while it was also reported that OPEC and non-OPEC compliance with oil output curbs has declined to 120% in June from 147% in May according to sources.

(CBS News/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump initially answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; when asked by a reporter if Russia was still targeting the US, although White House Press Secretary Sanders later stated the President was declining to answer shouted questions when he said &quot;no,&quot; and not disputing intelligence findings.

Yields were mixed across the curve but changes were close to 1bps. In early trade, Treasury yields touched session lows pushing the yield curve at its flattest point in almost 11 years with 10yr yield at 2.850 on the back of a soft Housing Starts reading, which was the lowest in 9 months. The long end of the curve underperformed heading into the close. 2s30s widened by c.3bps whilst 2s10s, 2s5s widened by c.2bps at settlement.

Fed also stated that manufacturers across all districts expressed concerns over tariffs in which many reported higher prices and supply disruptions due to new trade policy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>White House said the administration is continuing to talk to China regarding trade. Elsewhere, White House is reportedly aiming for a trade deal with Mexico before AMLO&#39;s inauguration in December which it thinks will spur a deal with Canada, while there were also reports that the White House sees a lot of progress on trade talks with Mexico but is continuing both NAFTA tracks including with Canada. (Axios/Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico&rsquo;s Economy Minister Guajardo said it is technically possible to reach a NAFTA deal before the next Mexican government takes office on December 1st and that they are still seeking a three country NAFTA deal. Guajardo added that he hopes to be in position to sign a deal by the end of November and hopes for an agreement in principal to be announced by the end of August, while he reiterated moving from NAFTA to a bilateral trade agreement with the US would be costly and effectively be similar to starting from scratch.

        "content": "<p>Asia bourses follow suit to the mostly positive performance seen on Wall St where earnings remained in focus and the DJIA notched a 5th consecutive gain, while financials led the S&amp;P 500 after Morgan Stanley beat estimates on its top and bottom lines. ASX 200 (+0.4%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) are in the green with outperformance in industrials and mining related sectors, while corporate updates have also spurred trade with CIMIC shares surging around 14% after its H1 results. Shanghai Comp. (Unch.) &nbsp;and Hang Seng (+0.3%) are just about kept afloat after further liquidity efforts by the PBoC and with the central bank also mulling incentives to bolster lending. However, upside is capped amid the ongoing US-China trade friction including recent comments from NEC Director Kudlow who believes President Xi Jinping is &#39;holding up&#39; progress on trade talks and is doubtful on the Chinese leader&rsquo;s intention of following through on trade reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX, USD trades lacklustre overnight following yesterday&rsquo;s pullback, although the DXY has found a base at the 95.00 level. Trade in the greenback&rsquo;s major counterparts has also left much to be desired with EUR/USD and GBP/USD little changed but well off recent lows, especially for GBP/USD after reports EU negotiators are considering extending Article 50 which provided the pair with some relief from PM May&rsquo;s ongoing Brexit headache and recent softer than expected CPI data. Elsewhere, AUD outperforms following a stellar jobs reports in which Employment Change surpassed forecasts at 50.9k vs. Exp. 17.0k which was predominantly fuelled by Full-Time jobs, while CNH is heavily pressured following the currency fix in which the PBoC weakened the reference rate beyond the psychological 6.7000 level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are uneventful with prices flat, while a reduction in the BoJ&rsquo;s purcases amounts of 10yr-25yr and 25yr+ bonds also failed to spur any reaction. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
