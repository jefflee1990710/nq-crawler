General Electric (GE) was another big gainer following Larry Culp&rsquo;s appointment to CEO. Praxair (PX) benefitted from Chinese regulatory approval of its merger with Linde AG (LIN GY). DaVita (DVA) pushed higher following a veto on a senate bill working in its favour and so did Marathon Petroleum (MPC), leading energy sector gains on the back of higher oil prices. Intel (INTC) was one of the day&rsquo;s losers after a downgrade at Barclays, citing a costly battle to maintain market share. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) was down on a negative report from Plainview. F5 Networks (FFIV) pushed lower after a downgrade at Piper Jaffray. Broadcasters, including Viacom (VIAB) and CBS (CBS), also were part of the day&rsquo;s biggest losers. Automakers strength attributed to USMCA trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday, falling after overnight news of a free trade deal in principle between US, Mexico and Canada. A slight easing in Italian budget tensions was also cited for the bund sell-off in early European trade, which Tsys sympathised with. 2-year yields edging up slightly, while longer-dated yields rose by as much as c.4bps at settlement. Major curve spreads also widened modestly (2s5s up 0.3bps, 2s30s wider by around 2.5bps, struggling to maintain ground above their 50DMAs, technicians observed).

Also, Deputy PM Di Maio said EU&#39;s Moscovici spoke out against Italy&rsquo;s budget plan to &quot;upset markets&quot; and there is no reason to question the 2019 2.4% budget deficit-GDP target.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Fed&#39;s Kashkari (Dove, Non-Voter) sees no reason to move rates up yet and tap the brakes since economic indicators are flashing green; he however warned the bond market is flashing yellow. Regarding trade, he is not seeing any near-term effects from the tariffs but believes it could be damaging in the long term, noting NAFTA has been a huge help to the US economy. He thinks the economy is probably not at full employment and warned of elevated recession risk currently citing trade wars, emerging markets and Fed hiking as downside risks. Fed&#39;s Rosengren said the FOMC should continue its current pace of raising rates and that hikes should continue to a &quot;mildly restrictive&quot; level to avoid need for faster rate increases later; he noted the further the US gets below full employment the higher the risk of inflation increasing. He also said continued growth and tighter labour markets will likely lead to imbalances including, but not limited to inflation. He expects strong growth to continue for now, though trade and emerging markets pose risks. Finally, Fed&#39;s Williams reiterated data-dependency and warned we shouldn&#39;t rest easy and think we won&rsquo;t run into future challenges as the Fed moves towards a more normal conduct of policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK lawmaker and Brexit hardliner Rees-Mogg stated it is prudent to back PM May noting that changing a leadership usually causes more problems than it solves. Rees-Mogg, an influential figure head of the ERG euro-sceptic think tank, has seemingly hinted that May could be secure in her position. Elsewhere, sources reported the UK is to plan to compromise on Irish border, to get a Brexit deal done; PM May therefore seems open to make a new Brexit offer to the EU on a major sticking point to unlock negotiations. Alongside this, Brexit Secretary Raab urged the EU to get serious, as he sees the EU approach to be one sided and allows no scope for compromise whilst UK Chancellor Hammond commenting on PM May&#39;s Chequers plan said it is a middle of the road choice, and is confident that the UK has the fiscal capacity to support a no-deal. Moreover, he noted the choice in November will be on the deal or no deal and that should focus minds and reiterated the government is not even considering a second referendum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US ISM MANUFACURING: </strong>The ISM manufacturing headline fell to 59.8 in September below the 60.0 consensus, from a prior 61.3. Analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the print signalled a strong manufacturing sector. &ldquo;August&rsquo;s 14-year high always looked a bit suspicious, it appeared to be supported by favourable seasonals, so at some point a correction was always on the cards.&rdquo; On the new orders sub-index, Pantheon said while it fell by over 3 points, it was still high by historical standards. &ldquo;The ISM responds to higher long-term interest rates with a long lag,&rdquo; Pantheon said, &ldquo;but eventually it will be weighed down by the Fed&rsquo;s hiking actions. For now, they believe the manufacturing sector is strong even though they expect the trade deficit will keep widening; they note the figure is consistent with output growth of only about 2% slower than the rate of growth of domestic demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.37% at 2925, NDX +0.23% at 7645, DJI +0.73% at 26652 SECTORS: </strong>Energy +1.47%, Materials +1.04%, Industrials +0.90%, Cons Discretionary -0.20%, Cons Staples -0.06%, Healthcare +0.54%, Financials +0.35%, Tech +0.49%, Telecoms -0.11%, Utilities -0.30%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Tesla (TSLA) was one of the day&rsquo;s biggest movers, paring back previous losses, following Elon Musk settling his lawsuit with the SEC. General Electric (GE) was another big gainer following Larry Culp&rsquo;s appointment to CEO. Praxair (PX) benefitted from Chinese regulatory approval of its merger with Linde AG (LIN GY). DaVita (DVA) pushed higher following a veto on a senate bill working in its favour and so did Marathon Petroleum (MPC), leading energy sector gains on the back of higher oil prices. Intel (INTC) was one of the day&rsquo;s losers after a downgrade at Barclays, citing a costly battle to maintain market share. Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) was down on a negative report from Plainview. F5 Networks (FFIV) pushed lower after a downgrade at Piper Jaffray. Broadcasters, including Viacom (VIAB) and CBS (CBS), also were part of the day&rsquo;s biggest losers. Automakers strength attributed to USMCA trade deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES $2.05 HIGHER AT $75.30 , BRENT (V8) SETTLES $2.25 HIGHER AT $84.98.</strong> Crude traded higher on Monday, with Brent trading above $85/bbl for the first time since November 2014, with traders re-focussing on the Iranian crude production and exportation ahead of the US re-applying sanctions on the nation&#39;s oil sector in November. &quot;Estimates vary of course, but a Bloomberg survey has Iranian production declining 140,000 bpd to 3.36 mmbpd and exports falling 229,000 bpd to 1.60 mmbpd,&quot; Citi&#39;s analysts said, though points out that in spite of that decline and the further downtrend in Venezuelan output, OPEC total production still edged higher during September. &quot;In our view this contrast fully highlights the extent to which the support for prices stems from the anticipation of future tightness rather than a current shortfall in supply,&quot; Citi adds. Iran&#39;s oil minister on Monday said the nation has no intention to cut oil production or exports. Elsewhere, Iraq&#39;s southern oil exports were said to be running at a clip of 3.56mln BPD in September, slightly lower than August levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>US T-NOTE FUTURES Z8) SETTLES 3+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-21+. </strong>The Treasury curve bear-steepened on Monday, falling after overnight news of a free trade deal in principle between US, Mexico and Canada. A slight easing in Italian budget tensions was also cited for the bund sell-off in early European trade, which Tsys sympathised with. 2-year yields edging up slightly, while longer-dated yields rose by as much as c.4bps at settlement. Major curve spreads also widened modestly (2s5s up 0.3bps, 2s30s wider by around 2.5bps, struggling to maintain ground above their 50DMAs, technicians observed).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* &nbsp;CAD, MXN: </strong>Still holding their bulk of its USMCA gains, albeit off best levels vs the Usd after pulling up short of resistance around 1.2765 and 18.5000 respectively to trade back below 1.2800 and close to 18.7000. The Loonie may have been undermined by a Canadian manufacturing PMI miss along with some consolidation/profit taking, while the Mxn was dictated by more commentary on the new NAFTA agreement from US President Trump, Canadian PM Trudeau and Mexican Foreign &amp; Economy Ministers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>The Pound derived some Brexit related momentum to bounce from near 1.3000 lows vs the Dollar where stops were lurking to briefly trade above 1.3100 on reports that the UK may be considering an Irish border compromise on customs to facilitate a deal with the EU. Cable is currently around 1.3050, with little lasting benefit from a stronger than expected UK PMI.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY, CHF: </strong>Still the noted G10 laggards, as Usd/Jpy extended its recent rally and range break trend just beyond 114.00 following dips in Japan&rsquo;s Q3 Tankan survey and September manufacturing PMI, while Usd/Chf remains within 0.9845-00 parameters in wake of a less robust Swiss manufacturing PMI that overshadowed a recovery in retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR: </strong>Was anchored around 1.1600 for most of the session after somewhat mixed Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and reports suggesting that the EU will formally reject Italy&rsquo;s proposed 2.4% 2019 deficit (in November, according to sources). It then slipped below the figure to consolidate around 1.1580 on more negative EU response on Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>NZD, AUD:</strong> Ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session pretty much where they started and all close to parity vs the Usd, UsdNzd just kept afloat of 0.6600 and 0.7200 respectively following a weaker than expected Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI overnight (50.0) and comments from White House advisor Kudlow noting that a trade agreement with China is not in the offing. Ahead, the Kiwi eyes NZIER Q3 confidence and cap u later, and the Aud awaits the RBA on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM:</strong> The Lira is heading the regional pack, with Usd/Try seeing a more convincing break below the 6.0000 handle as improved Turkish trade data (albeit on a hefty jump in exports) offset a disappointing manufacturing PMI (deeper in contraction territory).</p>\r\n",

The Loonie may have been undermined by a Canadian manufacturing PMI miss along with some consolidation/profit taking ahead of a BoC Lane speech later, while the Peso awaits Mexican manufacturing PMI ahead of more commentary on the new NAFTA agreement from US President Trump and Canadian PM Trudeau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound derived some Brexit related momentum to bounce from near 1.3000 lows vs the Dollar where stops were lurking to briefly trade above 1.3100 on reports that the UK may be considering an Irish border compromise on customs to facilitate a deal with the EU. Cable is currently around 1.3075, with little lasting benefit from a stronger than expected UK PMI. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still the noted G10 laggards, as Usd/Jpy extended its recent rally and range break trend just beyond 114.00 following dips in Japan&rsquo;s Q3 Tankan survey and September manufacturing PMI, while Usd/Chf remains within 0.9845-00 parameters in wake of a less robust Swiss manufacturing PMI that overshadowed a recovery in retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session pretty much where they started and all close to parity vs the Usd, as the single currency remains anchored around 1.1600 after somewhat mixed Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and reports suggesting that the EU will formally reject Italy&rsquo;s proposed 2.4% 2019 deficit (in November, according to sources). Note, Italian Finance Minister Tria attempted to placate markets and investors by calling for calm and promising to explain next year&rsquo;s budget plan, but EC VP Dombrovskis maintained that the plan violates the bloc&rsquo;s stability pact. Meanwhile, the antipodean Dollars only just kept afloat of 0.6600 and 0.7200 respectively following a weaker than expected Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI overnight (50.0) and comments from White House advisor Kudlow noting that a trade agreement with China is not in the offing.

The Loonie may have been undermined by a Canadian manufacturing PMI miss along with some consolidation/profit taking ahead of a BoC Lane speech later, while the Peso awaits Mexican manufacturing PMI ahead of more commentary on the new NAFTA agreement from US President Trump and Canadian PM Trudeau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound derived some Brexit related momentum to bounce from near 1.3000 lows vs the Dollar where stops were lurking to briefly trade above 1.3100 on reports that the UK may be considering an Irish border compromise on customs to facilitate a deal with the EU. Cable is currently around 1.3075, with little lasting benefit from a stronger than expected UK PMI. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still the noted G10 laggards, as Usd/Jpy extended its recent rally and range break trend just beyond 114.00 following dips in Japan&rsquo;s Q3 Tankan survey and September manufacturing PMI, while Usd/Chf remains within 0.9845-00 parameters in wake of a less robust Swiss manufacturing PMI that overshadowed a recovery in retail sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ending Monday&rsquo;s EU session pretty much where they started and all close to parity vs the Usd, as the single currency remains anchored around 1.1600 after somewhat mixed Eurozone manufacturing PMIs and reports suggesting that the EU will formally reject Italy&rsquo;s proposed 2.4% 2019 deficit (in November, according to sources). Note, Italian Finance Minister Tria attempted to placate markets and investors by calling for calm and promising to explain next year&rsquo;s budget plan, but EC VP Dombrovskis maintained that the plan violates the bloc&rsquo;s stability pact. Meanwhile, the antipodean Dollars only just kept afloat of 0.6600 and 0.7200 respectively following a weaker than expected Chinese Caixin manufacturing PMI overnight (50.0) and comments from White House advisor Kudlow noting that a trade agreement with China is not in the offing. Ahead, the Kiwi eyes NZIER Q3 confidence and cap u later, and the Aud awaits the RBA on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira is heading the regional pack, with Usd/Try seeing a more convincing break below the 6.0000 handle as improved Turkish trade data (albeit on a hefty jump in exports) offset a disappointing manufacturing PMI (deeper in contraction territory).</p>\r\n",

The bearish tone chimes with US Treasuries in wake of a NAFTA deal in principle between the US, Mexico and Canada, after issues preventing the 2 NA nations were finally resolved. Meanwhile, another spirited recovery in Italian bonds from a slightly deeper sub-123.00 low has weighed on core German paper along with some technical selling as the 158.90 Eurex high aligned with chart resistance ahead of 159.00, and prompted a retreat through support around 158.69 to test 158.50 (158.52 fresh intraday base). Back to Liffe, 3 month contracts are 1-2 ticks adrift approaching the UK manufacturing PMI, BoE lending data and then a speech from BoE&rsquo;s Tenreyro in the pm.</p>\r\n",

Hence, Bunds have traded either side of last Friday&rsquo;s 158.79 closing level within a 158.69-87 range and keeping tabs on BTPs that are trying consolidate off 122.97 lows. Ahead, Eurozone manufacturing PMIs may offer a distraction, but unlikely as events in Rome continue to dominate proceedings and dictate direction in the region.</p>\r\n",

US said the trade deal with Canada does not affect US steel and aluminium tariffs currently levied on Canada, and that these tariffs are separate to the trilateral deal. A Senior Trump Administration official said if Trump imposes auto tariffs, both Mexico and Canada will be accommodated in &quot;side letters&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ASIA-PAC</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asian stocks traded mixed following a rather uneventful lead from Wall St. on Friday where major bourses ended the day little changed as markets wrapped up a strong quarter where the S&amp;P showed it best quarterly gain since Q4 2013. ASX 200 (-0.6%) underperformed amid a slowdown in China&rsquo;s manufacturing sector shown by the Caixin data, while Nikkei 225 (+0.6%) was buoyed on currency effect in a continued weakness of the JPY following a downbeat Tankan release and Manufacturing PMI. Elsewhere, Hong Kong and Mainland China are closed today due to public holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indonesia&rsquo;s island Sulawesi was hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which triggered a 6m (20ft) tsunami that hit the cities of Palu and Donggala.

She said she believes Chequers will not destroy the single market and a Canada-style deal is not on the table for EU. In the interview, she refused to answer whether a no-deal Brexit will mean a hard border in Ireland. Note: BBC&rsquo;s Andrew Marr noted a no-deal under WTO would result in a hard border. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May, in a Sunday Times interview, told Tory rebels to &ldquo;stop playing politics&rdquo; and the only proposal on the table at the moment that delivers, is the Chequers plan, while she reiterated that no deal is better than a bad deal but she thought a good deal could be reached. She also challenged the EU to come forward with a counter proposal. (BBC/Times/Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has refused to rule out a leadership challenge to UK PM May. Furthermore, in an interview with The Sunday Times, Johnson questioned whether UK PM May believes in Brexit and branded her Chequers plan &ldquo;deranged&rdquo;. (BBC/Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU&rsquo;s Chief Negotiator Barnier told Labour leader Corbyn that they believed they might be close to finding agreement with UK PM May, but everyone is needs to act calmly and responsibly if the agreement was to get through parliament. (Guardian)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Labour leader Corbyn was told his stance made a no-deal Brexit more likely than not; according to sources in Brussels.

(Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former Brexit Secretary Davis said UK PM May&rsquo;s advisors fail to grasp the practicalities of the negotiations and have tendencies to believe &ldquo;exaggerations&rdquo; from Brussels. He also said he thinks it is 80%-90% likely there will be a Brexit deal. (Telegraph/Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Sky Poll revealed that 56% of Britons think Brexit will have a worse outcome than they expected when they voted in the EU referendum. (Sky News)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Commissioner Dombrovskis said what emerges so far from discussions in Italy does not seem to be in line with EU fiscal rules, he added it&#39;s important to stick to responsible fiscal policy to keep interest rates low. The Dutch PM has also expressed his concerns over the Italian budget plan.

(FT)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&rsquo;s Rehn (Neutral) said interest rates will remain at this low at least until summer 2019. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback was quiet amid a lack of participants from China and Hong Kong, while EUR/USD and GBP/USD were little changed throughout the session.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus has been on JPY weakness and CAD strength with the latter hitting 4-month highs vs. USD as WSJ reported that US and Canada are close to reaching a deal, ahead of the midnight deadline in Washington. USD/CAD then recuperated off lows on the run-up to the release of the official statement that US, Canada and Mexico reached a trade deal now dubbed USMCA. MXN also strengthened throughout the session with USD/MXN hitting lows of near 18.5400 amid the positive developments towards a trilateral deal. Elsewhere, the JPY hit new 2017 lows against the USD as a mostly disappointing Tankan survey and a downbeat Manufacturing PMI underpinned the pair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea&rsquo;s Foreign Minister announced that North Korea would not take the first steps towards denuclearisation without further guarantees from the US. He also warned of the increasing mistrust between Pyongyang and Washington DC. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Foreign Affairs Minister Lavrov said everything possible will be done to preserve Iran nuclear deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities traded mixed with WTI and Brent extending on gains towards last week&rsquo;s highs with traders citing growing concern over oil-related Iranian sanctions driving the prices higher. WTI flirted above USD 73.50/bbl while Brent regained the USD 83.00/bbl handle. Elsewhere, gold was little changed as the yellow metal mirrored the DXY&rsquo;s miniscule moves, while copper was subdued following a disappointing Chinese Caixin PMI which showed a slowdown in the manufacturing sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NHC said Hurricane Rosa (located in the Eastern North Pacific) has weakened to a tropical storm but is still expected to cause flooding rains over portions of North-Western Mexico and the Western US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Crude Oil Exports fell to 2.139mln bpd in July (vs. 2.2mln bpd in June). (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once again, Bunds were dictating the price action of Treasuries through European trade, with German debt catching a bid as Italian debt was sold; Bunds were also aided by somewhat disappointing data on the inflation front. A mixed/weak set of 0830am EST data helped Treasuries find highs, though highs could not be sustained with equities firming/toying with neutral levels. Reported position squaring was also playing a role in the afternoon, with traders squaring books ahead of month/quarter end. Major curves spreads were modestly wider, except for the 2s5s, which narrowed a touch. * US T-note futures (Z8) settled 1 tick higher at 118-25</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) underperforms amid a slowdown in China&rsquo;s manufacturing sector shown by the Caixin data, while Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) is buoyed on currency effect in a continued weakness of the JPY. Elsewhere, Hong Kong and Mainland China are closed today due to public holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is quiet amid a lack of participants with China and Hong Kong away. Focus has been on JPY weakness and CAD strength with the latter hitting 4-month highs as WSJ reported that US and Canada are close to reaching a deal, ahead of the midnight deadline in Washington. Meanwhile, a White House reporter tweeted that the Trump administration is growing confident that a deal with Canada is close and a trilateral deal may be published by 12:00 EDT. Elsewhere, the JPY hit new 2017 lows against the USD as a mostly disappointing Tankan survey and a downbeat Manufacturing PMI underpinned the pair.</p>\r\n",
