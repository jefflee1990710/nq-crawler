(Guardian)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dozens of Eurosceptic MPs in the UK&#39;s Conservative party are expected to express their frustration tomorrow regarding a lack of direction for the UK&#39;s future post-Brexit. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">ECB&rsquo;s Praet claims that overall an ample degree of monetary stimulus is still required and that inflation is to converge only gradually to target. (Newswires) </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Smets said ECB could take steps to phase out QE this summer but added investors could be right in pushing back forecasts for when the ECB might start hiking rates for first time since the financial crisis. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian President Mattarella said that the meetings on Monday showed there was no chance to form a government and a minority government would lead to new elections. Furthermore, Mattarella said he is worried about having an early election in summer and sees a new vote just after December, while he added that he sees possible market risks coming. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italy&#39;s League party said Italy must have a centre-right government or early elections and ruled out President Mattarella&#39;s suggestion of a neutral government until the end of the year. Furthermore, Five-Star Movement ruled out support for a neutral government and said elections must take place in July, while Berlusconi&#39;s Forza Italia is said to discuss the political situation with allies and is not worried of a vote but would rather have an election in autumn rather than in July</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK, France and Germany are close to a package deal to attempt to persuade US President Trump not to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a senior diplomat. (Channel 10/Twitter)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump is to announce decision on the Iran nuclear deal tomorrow at 1400ET/1700BST. Furthermore, there were later reports that US President Trump is said to be leaning towards dropping the Iran agreement and re-imposing sanctions according to diplomats familiar with discussions, although reports also added it is unclear if he would moderate a move to scrap the Iran nuclear deal by permitting EU countries to proceed with economic ties with Iran without being penalized by US.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Neutral)&nbsp;said there is plenty of stimulus for the economy amid tight labour market and said that the yield curve reflects scepticism regarding medium-term outlook. Furthermore, Kaplan said that the base case remains at 3 hikes total for this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures traded with little action before the Wall St open where the thee major indices spiked higher supported by outperformance in the energy sector, amid higher oil prices, with Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) which sent the S&amp;P 500 in close proximity to the 50DMA at 2679. News that European powers were close to a package deal to try and persuade Trump not to withdraw from the Iran deal then saw energy move lower and stocks in the energy sector pared gains. Tech names also printed a second consecutive day of gains supported by Apple (APPL) which hit a record high for the second straight session, boosted by Warren Buffett increasing its stake to USD 4.7bln followed by positive comments on the stock. SPX +0.35% at 2672, NDX +0.79% at 6822, DJI +0.40% at 24359.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were pretty much unchanged for the session with London away from market and in anticipation of the Thursday&rsquo;s CPI release and ahead of the USD 73bln auction this week where the Treasury will sell USD 31bln in 3yr, USD 25bln in 10yr and USD 17bln in 30yr. Amid thin volume, yields were only mildly higher on Monday with 5yr, 10yr and 30yr up by less than 1bps. US 10yr T-Notes futures settle half a tick lower at 119.22.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT:</strong> Equities higher, Treasuries down, DXY up, Crude flat.<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW: </strong>UK on holiday, Trump on Iran, Italian politics, Fed and ECB speak.<br /><strong>* AHEAD:</strong> China Trade balance, Fed&rsquo;s Powell to speak, Riksbank&rsquo;s minutes, earnings from DIS, JD, EA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>The Iranian Foreign Minister said on Monday that if the US pulls out of the nuclear deal, Tehran&#39;s reaction will not be pleasant as the US will have to pay a heavy price. French Foreign Minister reported that France will stick to the Iran nuclear deal no matter what the US does. In later trade, US President Trump tweeted he is to announce a decision on the Iran nuclear deal tomorrow at 14.00ET/17:00BST, note the official deadline was May 12th. UK, France and Germany have said to be close to a package deal to attempt to persuade US President Trump not to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, according to a senior diplomat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*FED SPEAK: </strong>Fed&rsquo;s Bostic (voter, dovish) appeared comfortable with &lsquo;some degree&rsquo; of overshooting on inflation and reiterated his view for 2 more rate hikes in 2018. Fed&rsquo;s Barkin (voter) not see outsized wage pressure and inflation is essentially at the Fed&#39;s 2% target.&nbsp; He believes monetary policy is still pretty accommodative. He declined to say how many rate hikes he sees for this year. Fed&rsquo;s Barkin (voter) said he does not see outsized wage pressure and inflation is essentially at the Fed&#39;s 2% target.&nbsp; He believes monetary policy is still pretty accommodative, but declined to say how many rate hikes he sees for this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*ECB SPEAK: </strong>ECB&rsquo;s Praet (dovish, chief-economist) claimed that overall an ample degree of monetary stimulus is still required, inflation is&nbsp; to converge only gradually to target. He noted the negative surprise in inflation seen for the month of April was mainly due to services prices which were likely to be related to volatile items. ECB&#39;s Smets (dove) said the &nbsp;ECB could take steps in phasing out QE this summer, according to an article published by the WSJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*ITALIAN POLITICS</strong>: On Monday a&nbsp; second round of negotiations began in the political space in an attempt to form a new government in the country, after no clear majority was reached at the March 4th elections and after the first consultations between parties failed to establish a coalition. Following the meetings this morning, President Mattarella announced there was no chance to form a government and that a minority government would lead to new elections in July or autumn. In response, Italy&#39;s League and&nbsp; Five-Star Movement &nbsp;have ruled out support for a neutral government until the end of the year, both urging elections to take place in July. Berlusconi&#39;s Forza Italia however, stated he is not worried of a vote but would rather have an election in autumn rather than in July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES:</strong> SPX +0.35% at 2672, NDX +0.79% at 6822 , DJI +0.40% at 24359 &nbsp;SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals: %, Cons Non-Cyclicals: -0.89%, Energy: +0.18%, Financials: +0.53%, Health Care: -0.06%, Industrials: +0.56%, Materials: +0.13%, Technology: +0.76%, Telecoms: -0.69%, Utilities: -0.57%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Equity futures traded with little action before the Wall St open where the thee major indices spiked higher supported by outperformance in the energy sector, amid higher oil prices, with Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP) which sent the S&amp;P 500 in close proximity to the 50DMA at 2679. News that European powers were close to a package deal to try and persuade Trump not to withdraw from the Iran deal then saw energy move lower and stocks in the energy sector pared gains. Tech names also printed a second consecutive day of gains supported by Apple (APPL) which hit a record high for the second straight session, boosted by Warren Buffett increasing its stake to USD 4.7bln followed by positive comments on the stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In earnings, Sysco Corp (SYY) outperformed after it reported a beat on both top and bottom line whilst Tyson Food (TSN) reported a miss on expectations. Dentsply Serona (XRAY) was down more than 6% after a cut of its FY2018 EPS outlook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In M&amp;A news, AthenaHealth (ATHN) was +25% after Elliot made a USD 160/shr all-cash offer amounting to approx. to USD 6.5bln. Nestle (NESN SW) and Starbucks (SBUX) are to form a global coffee alliance and International Flavours (IFF) is looking to acquire Frutarom for USD 7.1bln. Finally, sources reported that Shire and Takeda (4502 JT) are approaching a USD 64bln deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE: </strong>WTI futures settle USD 1.01 higher at USD 70.73/bbl, Brent futures settled higher by USD 1.30 at USD 76.17/bbl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oil prices were higher on Monday for most of the day amid tensions continuing in Iran. Oil pared back those gains ahead of the looming decision on Iran from Trump set to come tomorrow, and after it was reported that US, France and Germany are attempting the US from pulling out of the nuclear deal. OPEC Secretary General Barkindo has called for continued work to preserve the recent gains in the oil market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TREASURIES: </strong>US 10yr T-Notes futures settle half a tick lower at 119.22.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were pretty much unchanged for the session with London away from market and in anticipation of the Thursday&rsquo;s CPI release and ahead of the USD 73bln auction this week where the Treasury will sell USD 31bln in 3yr, USD 25bln in 10yr and USD 17bln in 30yr. Amid thin volume, yields were only mildly higher on Monday with 5yr, 10yr and 30yr up by less than 1bps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FOREX:</strong> <strong>*DXY</strong>: The Greenback has extended gains vs several major rivals and the well known EM currencies that have been on the run of late (ie Lira and Rouble to name just 2), with the index inching up to a marginal new 2018 best in the process, around 92.975. 93.000 is the obvious next target and a clean breach of some similar psychological levels in Dollar/G10 pairings may well provide the impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*GBP: </strong>Cable got close to the 1.3500 handle amidst all round USD buying, but bounced relatively firmly again towards 1.3550 as reports circulated suggesting that Japan&rsquo;s Takeda is close to agreeing a deal to buy Shire (maybe by tomorrow). Meanwhile, EURGBP dipped under 0.8800 as the single currency came under renewed pressure across the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*EUR/CHF/AUD:</strong> The weakest G10 links and all losing a bit more ground vs the Dollar as EURUSD briefly slipped below 1.1900 after more disappointing Eurozone data/survey news (much weaker than forecast German factory orders, sub-consensus Sentix and below 50 retail PMI) but recoup that level, while USDCHF tested resistance around 1.0050 following a Swiss CPI miss and AUDUSD slipped back through 0.7500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*NZD/JPY:</strong> The Kiwi has pared some of its recent losses to trade back around 0.7000 vs the USD and 1.0700 vs the AUD. USDJPY is flirting with its 10 DMA circa 109.35 that also aligns with a tenkan line, with the aforementioned M&amp;A developments offsetting reported export supply ahead of the Tokyo fix when Japanese participants returned from Golden Week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*SEK: </strong>Firmer vs the EUR (around 10.5100 vs 10.5675 at one stage) and keeping pace with the NOK as Riksbank&rsquo;s Jochnick reaffirmed guidance for a year end hike, adding that the Krona should appreciate over time and recent weakness is likely transitory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>*CAD:</strong> Had been firmer against the USD but reversed course as WTI and Brent declined following the reports that European powers are attempting to persuade Trump to stay in the nuclear deal, however, the pair found resistance ahead of 1.2900.</p>\r\n",

Usd/Jpy is flirting with its 10 DMA circa 109.35 that also aligns with a tenkan line, with the aforementioned M&amp;A developments offsetting reported export supply ahead of the Tokyo fix when Japanese participants returned from Golden Week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SEK&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmer vs the Eur (around 10.5100 vs 10.5675 at one stage) and keeping pace with the Nok as Riksbank&rsquo;s Jochnick reaffirmed guidance for a year end hike, adding that the Krona should appreciate over time and recent weakness is likely transitory.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.4%) was lifted by commodity names following recent upside in the complex and with big 4 bank Westpac underpinned after reporting a 6% increase in H1 cash earnings, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) underperformed on return from last week&rsquo;s holiday closures amid a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) shrugged off PBoC liquidity inaction to trade in the green and although a lack of progress was made during the US delegation visit, the consensus to keep on talking provided hope that an escalation to a full-blown trade war will likely be avoided. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet and failed to benefit from a subdued tone in Japan, as well as the BoJ Rinban announcement for JPY 840bln of JGBs across the curve with the amounts left unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations.

(Times)&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU and UK are said to have a list of topics for talks about the future relationship which include financial services, energy, customs and security, while there were also reports that a backup plan to impose border checks on trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK has been drafted by Senior Civil Servants.

Looking at the sectors, IT names are leading with sector-wide gains of almost a percent. Focus today has been more on stock specific stories. SMI heavyweight Nestle (+0.6%) has formed a partnership with Starbucks of which Nestle will pay USD 7.15bln in closing consideration. German insurer Allianz (+0.1%) sold an 8.4% shareholding in Banco BPI (+21.2%) to Caixabank (+0.1%).

The bottom line is that the latest report is highly unlikely to prevent the Fed from hiking rates a 2<sup>nd</sup> time this year in June, and the Greenback is holding gains vs all G10 counterparts bar the Pound as a result. DXY currently just above 92.750 vs 92.900 at best ahead of the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As noted, Sterling is showing a degree of resilience in UK holiday-thinned trade, with Cable bouncing firmly above the 1.3500 level and Eur/Gbp testing bids around 0.8000 amidst what appears to be a mixture of short-covering and perhaps some bargain hunting ahead of BoE super Thursday.

The pull back also came as markets position for next week&rsquo;s monster supply, as the Treasury is set to issue USD 73bln in 3-, 10- and 30-year paper this week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Dudley (Voter, Neutral)</strong> Said economic outlook looks pretty good; made progress on inflation, while he added that inflation being slightly higher than 2% is not an issue. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&rsquo;s Williams (Voter, Hawk)</strong> said wage growth is on an upward trend but not picking up fast and that wage growth figures are moderate as are inflation figures, while he also does not see a rapid increase in inflation coming. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Bostic (Voter, Dovish)</strong> said he still expects three hikes this year and could see 2 to 4 hikes depending on data. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (Non-Voter, Neutral)</strong> said everything he sees tells him there&#39;s a little more wage pressure and that best estimate of neutral rate is 2.50%-2.75%, while Fed&#39;s Kaplan also stated that the Fed should continue gradually removing accommodation. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fed&rsquo;s George (Non-Voter, Hawk)</strong> US has attained goals of full employment and price stability for now. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks began the week mostly positive as the region took its first opportunity to digest Friday&rsquo;s gains on Wall St despite the miss on NFP data, as well as the US delegate visit to China last week which ended with minimal progress although both sides agreed to keep talking. ASX 200 (+0.4%) was lifted by commodity names following recent upside in the complex and with big 4 bank Westpac underpinned after reporting a 6% increase in H1 cash earnings, while Nikkei 225 (-0.1%) underperformed on return from last week&rsquo;s holiday closures amid a firmer JPY. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.2%) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) shrugged off PBoC liquidity inaction to trade in the green and although a lack of progress was made during the US delegation visit, the consensus to keep on talking provided hope that an escalation to a full-blown trade war will likely be avoided. Finally, 10yr JGBs were quiet and failed to benefit from a subdued tone in Japan, as well as the BoJ Rinban announcement for JPY 840bln of JGBs across the curve with the amounts left unchanged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback was slightly weaker against its main counterparts for the majority of the session following the mixed US jobs data in which headline NFP missed forecasts and although unemployment fell to its lowest since 2000, it was accompanied by a decline in the participation rate. This provided some mild support to EUR/USD and GBP/USD, while USD/JPY briefly slipped below the 109.00 handle. Commodity-linked currencies were kept afloat by recent gains in the underlying complex, although the gains in AUD were later pared amid cross-related flows in which AUD/NZD pulled-back to test 1.0700 to the downside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were higher with WTI crude futures the forerunner in the complex as it rose to above USD 70.00/bbl for the first time since 2014 amid ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran, as well as reports that Saudi Arabia are said to be eyeing higher prices this year. Elsewhere, gold was largely dictated by USD-movements while copper also saw marginal gains amid a broad positive risk-tone led by China outperformance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.6%) is lifted by commodity names following recent upside in the complex and with big 4 bank Westpac underpinned after reporting a 6% increase in H1 cash earnings, while Nikkei 225 (-0.3%) underperforms amid a firmer JPY on return from last week&rsquo;s holiday closures. Elsewhere, Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) and Hang Seng (+0.5%) have shrugged off PBoC liquidity inaction to trade in the green and although a lack of progress was made during the US delegation visit, the consensus to keep on talking gives hopes that an escalation to a full-blown trade war will likely be avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the greenback is slightly weaker against its main counterparts following the mixed US jobs data in which headline NFP missed forecasts and unemployment fell to its lowest since 2000 in tandem with a decline in the participation rate. This has provided some mild support to EUR/USD and GBP/USD, while USD/JPY slipped below the 109.00 handle. Commodity linked currencies are also kept afloat by recent gains in the underlying complex in which WTI crude rose above USD 70/bbl for the first time since 2014, although the gains in AUD are to a lesser extent following the recent pull-back in AUD/NZD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are quiet and failed to benefit from a subdued tone in Japan, as well as the BoJ Rinban announcement for JPY 840bln of JGBs across the curve with the amounts left unchanged.</p>\r\n",
