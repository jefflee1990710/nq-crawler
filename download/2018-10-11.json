He added he is not going to fire Fed Chair Powell, but he is just disappointed. On the economy, he emphasized that having a strong dollar is not good for exports. In previous comments, NEC Director Kudlow stated the Fed is independent, highlighting the President has his own ideas. He interpreted yesterday&rsquo;s equities sell off move as a market correction, noting that the economy is very strong, but corrections do happen. He went on to explain that strong economic data can feed into strong stock market.

NEC Director Kudlow announced that Trump and Xi might meet at the G20 summit. Elsewhere, EU Commissioner Malmstrom said Europe is mulling not negotiating with the US on trade, adding that Trump&#39;s strategy is working. She also said EU is open to US talks on all industrial goods and cars. Later comments from the US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, where he said the US is committed to fair trading agreement with China as well as fair and reciprocal trade deals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ITALY:</strong> Italy&#39;s Senate voted to push the balanced budget goal beyond 2021, and approved the budget deficit target. The details of the plan remained in focus today with authorities expressing their views. The Italian Pension Chief said the plan would further increase 2021 pension spending by 1% of GDP whilst lowering the retirement age will cost future generations approximately EUR 100bln. Deputy PM Salvini reiterated he will not take even a cent off of the budget measures. On the EU side, Commissioner Moscovici said he has not rejected the plan yet. ECB sources reported that the central bank will not come to Italy&#39;s rescue if government and banks run out of cash unless EU bailout in place, adding that the OMT programme is conditional on bailout program, and that large-scale emergency liquidity assistance may also require ECB approval, and could be conditional on a bailout programme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB MINUTES:</strong> stated the main factors behind the growth slowdown may not be transitory, adding that trade tensions could lead to more general decline in confidence. They noted adverse effect of trade tensions are so far limited, but might still impact the Euro area more significantly over time. They said the domestic economy showing resilience and is mitigating downside risks. They stressed high frequency indicators have stabilised highlighting robustness of expansion. Finally, they highlighted domestic cost pressures are strengthening and broadening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The European Commission stated on Thursday &#39;we are not there yet&#39; on a Brexit deal, stressing there has been no breakthrough in negotiations. Similarly, the Irish Foreign Minister said that there is not an agreement on a way forward on a Brexit deal yet, and it is too soon to claim there is an agreement yet. Elsewhere, DUP lawmaker Sammy Wilson said if PM May breaks promise to the DUP then they will have no choice but to vote against her; he is also hopeful that he will not have to exercise threat to vote against the budget, noting that PM May has shared some details with the DUP which has made them nervous. Later reports in The Telegraph suggested UK PM May is facing a cabinet revolt over her new backstop plan amid concerns that it will keep Britain in a customs union with Brussels indefinitely. A spokeswoman then announced that Britain still intends to set out new proposals on regulatory aspects of Northern Ireland backstop in due course. As a side note, the budget is due to be released on October 29th, in-between the October and November summits. In late trade, the FT reported that UK PM May briefed her inner cabinet on Thursday evening that a historic Brexit deal is close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CPI </strong>rose 0.1% in September, a touch below the 0.2% consensus, and the headline declined to 2.2% YY, slightly below expectations of 2.3%. Core CPI rose 0.1% m/m and posted at 2.2%, both below consensuses. The Core measures were held down by used car prices which were down 3.0% whilst apparel and healthcare prices rose. Nonetheless, the latest inflation release is unlikely to change the Fed&rsquo;s interest rates trajectory with money markets currently pricing in ~78% probability of a hike at the December meeting, analysts at Pantheon argued, &ldquo;the Fed is focused on the very tight and tightening labour market and the threat of much faster wage gains&rdquo; adding &ldquo;rates are being raised because of future inflation risk; these numbers don&rsquo;t change that, and in any event a reversion to the core trend, 0.2%, is a very good bet for October&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JAPAN FINANCE MINISTER </strong>ASO said he is carefully watching financial markets moves, including FX which shows volatility; he noted that stock markets are falling sharply globally but he sees the global economy on firm note. He believes it is too simplistic to attribute the recent sell off in emerging markets to the Fed raising rates. He urged G20 to be vigilant in increasing capital outflows from EMs and noted some risks to global economy are materialising. He said to have not discuss Forex or Trade in the meeting with Mnuchin. Also, a Senior Japan Finance Ministry official stated it is necessary to consider some kind of response if market moves remain very volatile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -2.06% at 2728, NDX -1.14% at 6964, DJI -2.13% at 25053.

The complex was sliding all day, and the DOE reporting a larger than expecting headline crude stocks build did nothing to help (Crude +5.99mln, Cushing +2.36mln); products were mixed, with distillate stocks drawing by 2.66mln, while gasoline stocks built by 951k; crude production rose 0.9% in the week taking it to 11.2mln BPD.

The yield curve bull-flattened with short dated yields lower by c.4bps and long dated yields down by c.9bps at settlement. 2s30 5s30s were narrower by c.3bps.The US Treasury sold USD 15bln of 30-year bonds, stopping through by 0.9bps at a high yield of 3.344%. Demand for the auction was strong as indicated by the bid-to-cover which stood above recent averages. Directs were awarded the biggest share since April, indirects also took the largest portion since January whilst dealers were left with the smallest share since January. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>The Greenback has dipped again amidst more benign US inflation data and barbs from President Trump against the Fed for tightening the monetary screws too far. However, the index appears to have survived a test of 95.000 and a key Fib level a fraction below the big figure ahead of its 100 DMA (circa 94.980 and 94.850 respectively).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD, AUD, SEK:</strong> The antipodean Dollars have both extended rebounds from new multi-month/year lows vs their US counterpart and back up through round number/psychological levels that have been hampering the Kiwi and Aud, at 0.6500 and 0.7100 respectively. Meanwhile, the Sek continues to test chart resistance vs the Eur in wake of forecast beating Swedish inflation data that fuelled December Riksbank tightening prospects and added tangible macro justification to talk about potentially removing NIRP next year from Skingsley. Note, the cross is back on the 10.4000 handle having declined to within a whisker of the mtd base earlier (10.3750 vs 10.3725).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR:</strong> A top performer in G10 behind AUD, almost touching 1.1600 vs the Usd after breaching upside chart levels between 1.1572-94, but not quite reaching big option expiries between the big figure and 1.1620. The single currency has subsequently faded to retest bids/support ahead of 1.1550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP, CAD, CHF:</strong> All firmer vs the Buck, but off best levels as Cable continues to encounter offers around 1.3250 on advances and reports that the UK and EU remain some distance from a Brexit deal given certain big issues yet to be resolved. Meanwhile, the Loonie has eked more gains vs its US rival towards 1.3025, largely shrugging off flat Canadian new house prices vs mostly underwhelming US releases (CPI and initial claims vs firmer real wages), and the Franc is back down near 0.9900 vs not far from 0.9850 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* JPY:</strong> A net, albeit relatively light loser and underperformer following a gradual loss of momentum when 112.00 vs the Dollar held and then slipping below that level. To recap, from a tech perspective 112.16 is a key Fib that could be pivotal on a closing basis, but Wall Street&rsquo;s performance after Wednesday&rsquo;s mauling could overshadow chart dynamics. Elsewhere, the JPY has strengthened by around 3 figures over the last few days, and it has not escaped policymakers&rsquo; attention; Finance Minister Aso in US hours said that he is monitoring FX levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Most regional currencies remain on course to rack up decent gains vs the Usd, with the Try, Zar and Brl all deriving independent support from upbeat data, but the Lira conscious about Friday&rsquo;s Turkish court ruling on the release of US Pastor Brunson and the Real still jittery ahead of the Presidential run-off given probes into 1st round victor Bolsonaro&rsquo;s economic advisor and favoured choice for the high profile position as Finance Minister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>FED SUPPLY: </strong>The US Treasury will auction USD 74bln in 3-year (USD 36bln of new paper, Wednesday), 10-year (USD 23bln reopening, Wednesday) and 30-year (USD 15bln re-opening, Thursday); with approximately USD 24bln maturing at the mid-month settlement, the auctions will raise USD 50bln in new cash. UBS notes that the biggest problem for the bond market to deal with this week is UST supply: &quot;The Fed will issue a total of $230bn of securities this week [including bills]. The timing of the auctions could cause the market some issues at a time when it has been struggling to digest larger auction sizes,&quot; UBS fixed income strategists said, &quot;on Wednesday the treasury issues both US 3y and US 10y bonds, but the real test for the market will be Thursday&#39;s USD 15bn of US 30-year, especially given the recent steepening of the UST curve.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FED ADD-ONS:</strong> There are no Fed holdings maturing at the mid-month settlement, TD Securities notes. The bank also points out that the Fed&#39;s balance sheet normalisation plans sees the run-off cap rise to USD 30bln this month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW: </strong>Analysts at Societe Generale say the 30-year sector has mixed set-up ahead of Thursday&#39;s auction. &quot;The sector is fair on the Treasury spline versus the old 30s, whereas the outright yield is trading above all the auction stops since 2014 and is cheap on the curve since the last auction as 5s30s steepen,&quot; SocGen writes. Additionally, it adds that any cover demand from the record short positioning in the sector from the speculators will likely support auction demand. &quot;We are slightly positive on the upcoming bond auction through the upcoming September CPI release before the auction on Thursday, which will likely provide better clarity for the market to setup for the auction.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>30-YEAR RECENT AUCTION HISTORY: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>High-yield: prev. 3.088% vs 6-auction average of 3.068%.</li>\r\n  <li>Tail: prev. 0.0bps vs 6-auction average of -0.1bps.</li>\r\n  <li>Bid/cover: prev. 2.34x vs 6-auction average of 2.35x.</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers: prev. 27.0% vs 6-auction average of 27.6%.</li>\r\n  <li>Direct: prev. 11.3% vs 6-auction average of 10.5%.</li>\r\n  <li>Indirect: prev. 61.7% vs 6-auction average of 62.0%.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>USD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Greenback has dipped again amidst more benign US inflation data and barbs from President Trump against the Fed for tightening the monetary screws too far. However, the index appears to have survived a test of 95.000 and a key Fib level a fraction below the big figure ahead of its 100 DMA (circa 94.980 and 94.850 respectively). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD/SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipodean Dollars have both extended rebounds from new multi-month/year lows vs their US counterpart and back up through round number/psychological levels that have been hampering the Kiwi and Aud, at 0.6500 and 0.7100 respectively. Meanwhile, the Sek continues to test chart resistance vs the Eur in wake of forecast beating Swedish inflation data that fuelled December Riksbank tightening prospects and added tangible macro justification to talk about potentially removing NIRP next year from Skingsley. Note, the cross is back on the 10.4000 handle having declined to within a whisker of the mtd base earlier (10.3750 vs 10.3725).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still best of the rest in G10 land and almost touching 1.1600 vs the Usd after breaching upside chart levels between 1.1572-94, but not quite reaching big option expiries between the big figure and 1.1620. The single currency has subsequently faded to retest bids/support ahead of 1.1550.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/CAD/CHF &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All firmer vs the Buck, but off best levels as Cable continues to encounter offers around 1.3250 on advances and reports that the UK and EU remain some distance from a Brexit deal given certain big issues yet to be resolved. Meanwhile, the Loonie has eked more gains vs its US rival towards 1.3025, largely shrugging off flat Canadian new house prices vs mostly underwhelming US releases (CPI and initial claims vs firmer real wages), and the Franc is back down near 0.9900 vs not far from 0.9850 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A net, albeit relatively light loser and underperformer following a gradual loss of momentum when 112.00 vs the Dollar held and now closer to the base of parameters extending to 112.50. To recap, from a tech perspective 112.16 is a key Fib that could be pivotal on a closing basis, but Wall Street&rsquo;s performance after Wednesday&rsquo;s mauling could overshadow chart dynamics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most regional currencies remain on course to rack up decent gains vs the Usd, with the Try, Zar and Brl all deriving independent support from upbeat data, but the Lira conscious about Friday&rsquo;s Turkish court ruling on the release of US Pastor Brunson and the Real still jittery ahead of the Presidential run-off given probes into 1st round victor Bolsonaro&rsquo;s economic advisor and favoured choice for the high profile position as Finance Minister.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>As was the case with the July meeting, September&rsquo;s policy announcement delivered little in the way of fireworks with the governing council&rsquo;s statement broadly unchanged from the prior release. The press conference saw Draghi note that incoming data confirmed the Bank&rsquo;s previous assessment that growth is broad-based, inflation is rising and the strength of the economy supports confidence. In terms of the latest economic projections 2018 and 2019 growth forecasts were lowered to 2.0% and 1.8% respectively with all other projections maintained. As such, this aspect of the release will likely garner little attention from markets this time around. Instead, markets once again might instead opt to focus on whether there was a more detailed discussion on the Bank&rsquo;s reinvestment policy; something which Draghi stated was not discussed but will be a topic of discussion at one of the meetings before year-end (note, Draghi&rsquo;s account of proceedings can differ from the official account). Furthermore, markets are still eager to pin the Bank down on a precise timing for the next rate hike but are likely to be left disappointed by this month&rsquo;s account. On this matter, ECB&rsquo;s Knot recently stated that the ECB are comfortable with the wording of forward guidance adding that a hike may come sooner or later than guided. Knot even went on to state that one potential option for the Bank would be publishing how many times they intend to raise rates in a given year. However, such discussions at this stage appear to be more theoretical (possibly confined to the hawks at the ECB) and are unlikely to be detailed in the account of the September meeting; Knot suggested the ECB will begin discussions on the timing of rate lift-off in January. Finally, there might have been some discussion regarding the risks surrounding Italy but such discussions could be considered stale by the market given that the meeting was 4 weeks ago.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-2.7%) was dragged lower by the tech sector, closely followed by the energy names, while Nikkei 225 (-3.9%) plumbed the depths amid weakness in mining and energy names alongside currency effects. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-3.5%) and Shanghai Comp. (-5.2%) dived deeper into bear-market territory in a continuation of the tech sell-off, with the former hitting lows last seen in February while the latter tumbled to 4-year lows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC sets CNY mid-point at 6.9098 (Prev. 6.9072) (Newswires)<br />PBoC skips open market operations for a net neutral daily position</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump does not think Dow declined due to US-China trade war, the market sell-off is correction they have been waiting for, for a long time.

Fundamentally, not much to glean from latest ECB comments, but the minutes may provide something to trade off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/GBP/JPY - All moderately firmer vs the Buck, as the Franc cleared resistance at 0.9900, but could not breach 0.9850, and interestingly also retreated from sub-1.1400 levels against the Eur amid suspicions of official intervention. The Loonie is rangebound around 1.3050 ahead of more Canadian housing data, while Cable climbed towards 1.3250 at one stage, but lost momentum and is now back just below 1.3200 where offers have been touted.

Meanwhile, yet more choppy price action in BTPs between 120.48 and 119.44 ahead of Italian supply that was not taken down well, or easily, but appears to have been given the benefit of doubt and enough concession to prevent further fall-out, for now. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are also off overnight safe-haven highs and the curve has unwound a degree of its re-flattening in preparation for long bond issuance that follows CPI and initial claims.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>SEK</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hot on the heels of its Scandi peer, the Sek has seized pole position on the G10 grid and extended gains on the back of relatively hawkish Riksbank rhetoric, as Swedish CPI and CPIF readings also topped market expectations. In response, December rate hike odds have narrowed to better than evens, while Eur/Sek is testing psychological support circa 10.4000 ahead of the nearest downside tech level around 10.3725 (early October low).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next best majors and beneficiaries of the latest Usd downturn (DXY capped below 95.500 within a 95.173-431 range), with the Kiwi extending its recovery from Wednesday&rsquo;s lows towards 0.6500 and Aud retesting 0.7100. Some additional impetus for the former via less deflationary NZ food prices overnight, while the latter has not really been derailed by RBA&rsquo;s Lowe advocating higher US interest rates and a stronger Greenback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firmly back above 1.1500 vs the Usd and pivoting 1.1550 within a higher range flanked by hefty option expiry interest (1.8 bn at the 1.1500 strike and 2.3 bn from 1.1600-20), while also facing chart resistance in the 1.1572-91 region that houses a daily top, 55 DMA and Fib. Fundamentally, not much to glean from latest ECB comments, but the minutes may provide something to trade off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/CAD/GBP/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All moderately firmer vs the Buck, as the Franc cleared resistance at 0.9900, but could not breach 0.9850, and interestingly also retreated from sub-1.1400 levels against the Eur amid suspicions of official intervention. The Loonie is rangebound around 1.3050 ahead of more Canadian housing data, while Cable climbed towards 1.3250 at one stage, but lost momentum and is now back just below 1.3200 where offers have been touted. The Jpy retains an underlying safe-haven bid, but also failed to sustain gains through a big figure, at 112.00, and now eyeing a 50% Fib (112.16) from a tech perspective alongside upcoming US inflation data and related moves in Treasury yields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lira stands out amidst broad rebounds vs the Dollar across the region as Usd/Try crosses the 6.0000 handle to the downside on a combination of more concerted efforts to get runaway Turkish inflation back down towards target and a wider than forecast current account surplus. Elsewhere, the Rand and Real also have data to digest in the form of SA manufacturing production and Brazilian retail sales that might deflect some attention away from domestic politics, for a while at least.</p>\r\n",

The positive momentum gathered pace and propelled the 10 year German debt future up to 158.71 (+83 ticks) from an initial 158.33 print and fleeting dip to 158.31, but Bunds have subsequently drifted back down awaiting confirmation and validation before making the next decisive move. Inverse correlations to Italian BTPs are still impacting intermittently, and a decent rebound from 119.50 to 120.44 may also have contributed to the fade in core Eurozone bonds amidst more commentary from Government officials and ahead of hefty supply.</p>\r\n",

The US weekly APIs printed a larger-than-expected build in crude stocks, although, the initial reaction was muted. NHC reported that Hurricane Michael has weakened to a tropical storm over South-Central Georgia, storm flooding gradually decreasing along the Gulf Coast. Some traders cite the decline in oil to the EIA stating that US production is to grow faster than expected, while others simply note a correction.

There was little if any movement after PPI data. The complex was taking its cue from the wider risk environment (risk-off) as stocks sold-off, VIX rose, and oil ran into sellers.

The US Treasury also sold&nbsp; USD 23bln 10-year bonds, tailing by 0.3bps; demand was scarce and cover was below the 6-week average.

        "content": "<p>Asian stocks drown in a sea of red following the battered lead from Wall St. amid a selloff in tech stocks where the sector posted its worst day since 2011. Dow and S&amp;P notched their biggest one-day drop since early February, while Nasdaq fell below its 200 DMA to experience its largest single-day decline since June 2016. ASX 200 (-1.8%) is dragged lower by the tech sector, closely followed by the energy names, while Nikkei 225 (-3.6%) is weighed on by mining and energy names alongside currency effects. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-3.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (-2.6%) dive deeper into bear-market territory in a continuation of the tech sell-off, with the former hitting lows last seen in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX Markets, the greenback trades on the backfoot following the retreat to sub-95.50 levels to print fresh intra-day lows just under 95.20, while EUR/USD found a firmer footing above 1.1550, while GBP/USD reclaimed the 1.3200 handle and approaches 1.3250 on the back of the dollar pullback. Elsewhere, USD/JPY tested 112.00 to the downside amid safe haven flows. In terms of antipodeans, NZD outperforms the AUD with the help of an improvement in the Food Price Index, while the AUD/NZD cross fell below 1.0950.</p>\r\n",
