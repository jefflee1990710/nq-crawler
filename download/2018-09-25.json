Navarro added that trade will be discussed with the EU at the G20. Additionally, US Trade Representative Lightizer said the US-Mexico trade deal will rebalance US trade deficit with Mexico though an amount of issues remains between Canada and the US, since time is running out and Canada is not making concessions. He also said he will deal with steel and aluminium tariffs after NAFTA is resolved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>UK PM May reiterated that any deal which breaks up the integrity of the UK is a bad deal adding she would prefer no deal rather than a Canada style outcome. Additionally, an EU document stated that the EU and Britain should have free trade area between them though this cannot extend to the whole of Britain. The document also emphasized that the Chequers proposal would give UK an unfair competitive advantage in the goods market, and that cross border supply chains between EU and UK would not operate seamlessly after Brexit under a free trade agreement. Elsewhere, a Labour Brexit spokesman said it looks like the UK are heading for a bad deal or no deal, and they have not ruled out the option of remain in a second referendum. As a heads up, UK PM May is to meet US President Trump on Wednesday to discuss Brexit and a post-Brexit trade deal; ahead of the meeting May said it is not in the national interest to have a general election, and again ruled out second referendum; says she is not bluffing a that a no-deal is better than a bad deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&#39;s Praet stated that there was nothing new in ECB Draghi&#39;s speech yesterday (where Draghi stated that he saw a &ldquo;vigorous&rdquo; pick-up in underlying inflation &ndash; which was a reference to the ECB forecasts, rather than a view about current inflation). Praet noted that instead it will take months before higher wages lift inflation as things are moving slowly but in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BOE: </strong>BOE&#39;s Vlieghe said that they are not at the point yet that the BoE would change its smooth Brexit assumptions, claiming his own central forecast, of one/two rate hikes per year, is broadly right assuming wage and productivity growth picks up. Vlieghe added that the QE unwind does not necessarily have a material effect on the yield curve shape or on the economy if it is well communicated and gradual. He vowed that more communication from the BoE can be expected as QE unwind approaches, and expectations are for yield curves to be flat again on average.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS: </strong>US President Trump said to be looking forward to having a great relationship with Iran, but Iran must change its rhetoric; Trump added that more Iranian sanctions will follow after resumption of oil sanctions on Iran on 5 November. US National Security Advisor Bolton warned that the US is watching Iran, and &quot;we will come after you&quot; if they cross the US or its allies Trump also announced they are in process of setting a meeting with North Korea. Canada&#39;s Foreign Minister Freeland said she hopes to meet he Saudi counterpart this week to discuss the two nations&#39; dispute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CONSUMER CONFIDENCE </strong>rose to a 18-year high at 138.4, higher than the 132 consensus, not far now from its all-time high of 144.7. This suggests consumer spending remains well-anchored in Q3 and signals an encouraging start to Q4, analysts at Oxford Economics said; however, OxEco expects personal consumption to moderate from the strong pace seen in Q2 and expect an average growth rate of 2.5% this year. The differential between jobs plentiful and jobs hard to get widened to 32.5 from 32.0, auguring well for the unemployment rate to keep falling.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX -0.1% at 2916, NDX +0.2% at 7563, DJI -0.25% at 26495. </strong>SECTORS: Energy +0.5%, Materials -0.5%, Industrials -0.3%, Cons Discretionary +0.6%, Cons Staples -0.8%, Healthcare -0.3%, Financials -0.4%, Tech -0.0%, Telecoms +0.1%, Utilities -1.2%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Abiomed (ABMD) up on strong performance of Impella heart pumps. Northrop Grumman (NOC) was buoyed with other defence names while US President Trump gave a typically &lsquo;America First&rsquo; speech at the UN. Energy names were supported by continued strength of crude (BHGE). McDonald&rsquo;s (MCD) was higher after Monday announcing a new organisational structure. Nike (NKE) was higher ahead of AMC earnings. Automakers (GM, F, FCAU) were lower after BMW (BMW GY) cut guidance. Some chipmakers &ndash; like Intel (INTC), Microchip Technology (MCHP) &ndash; were under pressure after a sector downgrade at Raymond James and Keybanc. Centurylink (CL) CFO departed to oversee the Sprint (S) T-Mobile (TMUS) merger, sending shares lower. Financials were trading firmer early doors as yields rose in anticipation of a Fed hike on Wednesday, though struggled to hold on to the highs. Defensive utilities were under pressure. In M&amp;A, sonic Corp (SONC) jumped after Inspire Brands acquired the company for $1.6bln. Square (SQ) introduces Square payroll app, putting pressure on Automated Data Processing (ADP), Paychex (PAYX), eBay (EBAY).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (X8) SETTLES $0.20 HIGHER AT $72.28/BBL; BRENT (X8) SETTLES $0.67 HIGHER AT $81.87/BBL. </strong>Crude continues to tick up, without any major fresh catalysts. US President Trump continued his criticism of OPEC/OPEC+ in his comments at the UN General Assembly, though there was little by way of a sustained/significant price reaction. This has left traders to continue chewing over the impending sanctions on Iranian crude (which kick in on 5 November). &ldquo;To be clear,&rdquo; Citi says &ldquo;we think OPEC&rsquo;s stance is closer to &lsquo;not now&rsquo; than &lsquo;never&rsquo;, and some additional supply may still be forthcoming after the full OPEC summit in December 3 in Vienna.&rdquo; But Citi adds that in the meantime the market is posting fresh highs on the assumption that sanctions on Iranian exports will soon reduce overall supply, with the OPEC+ response running behind the curve.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US T-NOTE FUTURES (Z8) SETTLE 5+ TICKS LOWER AT 118-14+. </strong>The Treasury complex drifted lower on Tuesday, pushing the 10yr yield to a four-month high ahead of the FOMC meeting tomorrow where the MPC is widely expected to hike rate by 25bps. Most of the selling action was concentrated in the front-end and belly of the curve where yields were higher by c.2bps at settlement. 2s10s, 2s30s and 5s30s were all narrower by c1bps. Today&rsquo;s 5yr note auction tailed by 0.4bps; the bid-to-cover came in at 2.997 showing demand was uninspiring and at the lowest since December. Indirects were awarded the smallest share since May, directs took the highest portion since June and similarly dealers were left with the biggest share since May. On Thursday the US Treasury will auction USD 31bln in 7yr notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* G10 FX: </strong>Not much additional movement in USD parings, or the DXY that is keeping its head above 94.000, marginally, but the EUR has crept past the GBP at the front of the major pack to revisit resistance ahead of 1.1800, like the 1.1780 Fib, though then found support below that level. With Cable sticky around 1.3150 in comparison, Eur/Gbp is inching back over 0.8950, while Eur/SEK is now probing 10.3600+ levels after the Crown initially held firm on confirmation of Swedish PM Lofven losing a vote of confidence. Elsewhere, the NZD remains a relative performer ahead of NZ trade data tonight and the RBNZ policy meeting on Wednesday, with the OCR expected to be maintained at 1.75%, but some prospect of more upbeat forward guidance given considerably stronger than forecast growth in Q2 &ndash; full preview available via the Research Suite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, CAD, CHF, JPY: </strong>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and arguably rotating in tighter concentric circles as the countdown to tomorrow&rsquo;s FOMC begins in earnest &ndash; preview accessible through headline feed or direct for download on the Research suite, but in short another &frac14; point hike is all but priced in vs multiple variables via the SEP, policy statement and Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s presser/Q&amp;A. Aud/Usd is hovering just above 0.7250 awaiting more US-China trade developments and the Loonie is pivoting 1.2950 following latest NAFTA updates via US Trade Advisor Navarro (little issues preventing an accord with Canada, vote on final deal likely after November), USTR Lighthizer (claiming big differences and no concessions from Canada) and Canadian PM Trudeau (potential to build on US-Mexican agreement, but aware of country&rsquo;s needs and will work to those ends). Conversely, the Franc and Jpy are both still lagging and softer vs the Usd on relative SNB/BoJ vs Fed policy dynamics, with the former 2 firmly in easing mode, but latter all set to continue its normalisation process as noted above. Usd/Chf circling 0.9650 and Usd/Jpy eyeing 113.00 resistance/supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EM: </strong>Another rise in Brent prices to just over $82/brl has helped the Rub maintain its recovery momentum (towards 65.5200 at best), but the Ars has been hit hard along with other Argentine assets following the resignation of Central Bank Chief Caputo. In fact, the Peso open was delayed due to a lack of Usd supply and the pair subsequently gapped up over 4.5% to 39.0000+. Elsewhere, the Czk is also awaiting a policy verdict and anticipated 25 bp tightening by the CNB on Wednesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP - FOMC RATE DECISION DUE AT 1900 BST/1400 EST ON 26 SEPTEMBER 2018</strong>; CHAIR POWELL WILL GIVE A PRESS CONFERENCE AT 1930 BST/1430 EST. A 25bps rate hike is priced in, attention is on December 2018 meeting, as well as the 2019 &lsquo;dots&rsquo;. Risks that the median &#39;dot&#39; in 2019 may fall given more participants making projections. FOMC forecast horizon will extend through 2021. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20165/download\"><em><strong>Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview</strong></em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* COMING-UP - RBNZ RATE DECISION DUE AT 2200BST/1600CDT/0500HKT ON 26 SEPTEMBER 2018.</strong> RBNZ expected to keep the Official Cash Rate at 1.75%. Expectations for the latest RBNZ rate decision are one-sided for a continued pause with all analysts surveyed forecasting the central bank to maintain the Official Cash Rate at 1.75% where it has been since September 2016. In addition, the central bank is also expected reiterate its view for rates staying expansionary for a considerable period and that the next move could either be a hike or cut. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/20160/download\"><em><strong>Click here to access the full RANsquawk preview.</strong></em></a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The US Treasury will auction USD 93bln in 2s (USD 37bln on Monday), 5s (USD 38bln on Tuesday) and 7s (USD 31bln on Thursday); with USD 13bln maturing at the end of the week. The US will also sell USD 17bln of 2yr FRN this week. This week brings approx. USD 93bln of redemptions and approx. USD 8bln of coupon payments. Monday&rsquo;s 2-year auction saw weak cover, with the Fed expected to lift rates by 25bps on Thursday, and analysts suggest that some of this sentiment may also be on view at the 5-year auction. Analysts at Societe Generale argue that the current 5-year note is trading rich on the spline compared to older 5s, but the sector has seen some cheapening on the curve after hitting its richest levels since last September against 2s and 10s, which SocGen suggests could be a positive for the auction. &ldquo;The recent sell-off has pushed 5-year yields towards the cheapest the sector has been since 2008 and more than 18bps cheaper than the August auction result,&rdquo; and adds that it holds a slightly positive bias going into the auction, though notes the risks of a small tail.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>High Yield % (Prev. 2.765%)&nbsp;</li>\r\n  <li>Bid to Cover x (Prev. 2.49x, 6 auction avg. 2.53x)</li>\r\n  <li>Dealers % (Prev. 26%, 6 auction avg. 30%)</li>\r\n  <li>Directs % (Prev. 63%, 6 auction avg. 58%)</li>\r\n  <li>Indirects % (Prev. 2%, 6 auction avg. 2%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>G10</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much additional movement in USD parings, or the DXY that is keeping its head above 94.000, marginally, but the EUR has crept past the GBP at the front of the major pack to revisit resistance ahead of 1.1800, like the 1.1780 Fib. With Cable sticky around 1.3150 in comparison, Eur/Gbp is inching back over 0.8950, while Eur/SEK is now probing 10.3600+ levels after the Crown initially held firm on confirmation of Swedish PM Lofven losing a vote of confidence. Elsewhere, the NZD remains a relative performer ahead of NZ trade data tonight and the RBNZ policy meeting on Wednesday, with the OCR expected to be maintained at 1.75%, but some prospect of more upbeat forward guidance given considerably stronger than forecast growth in Q2 &ndash; full preview available via the Research Suite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/CAD/CHF/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All narrowly mixed vs the Greenback and arguably rotating in tighter concentric circles as the countdown to tomorrow&rsquo;s FOMC begins in earnest &ndash; preview accessible through headline feed or direct for download on the Research suite, but in short another &frac14; point hike is all but priced in vs multiple variables via the SEP, policy statement and Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s presser/Q&amp;A. Aud/Usd is hovering just above 0.7250 awaiting more US-China trade developments and the Loonie is pivoting 1.2950 following latest NAFTA updates via US Trade Advisor Navarro (little issues preventing an accord with Canada, vote on final deal likely after November), USTR Lighthizer (claiming big differences and no concessions from Canada) and Canadian PM Trudeau (potential to build on US-Mexican agreement, but aware of country&rsquo;s needs and will work to those ends). Conversely, the Franc and Jpy are both still lagging and softer vs the Usd on relative SNB/BoJ vs Fed policy dynamics, with the former 2 firmly in easing mode, but latter all set to continue its normalisation process as noted above. Usd/Chf circling 0.9650 and Usd/Jpy eyeing 113.00 resistance/supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another rise in Brent prices to just over $82/brl has helped the Rub maintain its recovery momentum (towards 65.5200 at best), but the Ars has been hit hard along with other Argentine assets following the resignation of Central Bank Chief Caputo. In fact, the Peso open was delayed due to a lack of Usd supply and the pair subsequently gapped up over 4.5% to 39.0000+. Elsewhere, the Czk is also awaiting a policy verdict and anticipated 25 bp tightening by the CNB on Wednesday.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (flat) losses were initially led by weakness in the financial sector but the index recovered later in the session. The Nikkei 225 (+0.3%) was choppy in lock-step with an indecisive currency. The Shanghai Composite (-0.6%) underperformed on the return from the long weekend and took its first opportunity to react to China&rsquo;s cancellation of trade discussions, while the PBoC conducted a net liquidity drain and China was also reportedly to create a national system to monitor government spending. Elsewhere, Hang Seng and KOSPI are closed due to public holidays. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower in which prices tested the 150.00 level to the downside coinciding with weakness in T-notes, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement was for a relatively reserved JPY 475bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 60bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily drain of CNY 90bln. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8440 (Prev. 6.8357)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s Vice Commerce Minister said China is willing to promote US-China trade in a fairer fashion and is hoping US takes more positive steps as well, although he added trade talks with the US are hard to proceed as US has abandoned mutual understanding and the restart of trade talks depends completely on the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&#39;s NDRC Vice Chairman said China is able to offset trade risks through expanding domestic demand and that China will give more support for Chinese firms to expand into international markets including EU, Japan and Africa, while he reiterated the domestic economy is resilient. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ Minutes from July meeting noted that most members stated it was appropriate to continue persistent easing and a few said it was appropriate to adopt forward guidance to strengthen commitment to reach target. Most members agreed to the proposal that Governor Kuroda should make it clear at the briefing that yield would be allowed to move both directions at double the current range and some members said flexible control of long-term yields would contribute to maintaining and improvement of market function. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan&#39;s Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga confirmed US-Japan trade talks are to take place on Tuesday 25th September. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ&#39;s Kuroda said the BoJ will not adjust monetary policy with inflation still half-way through the Bank&#39;s 2% inflation target and states that likelihood of interest rate differential widening between US and Japan would lead to increase in USD/JPY (all things equal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU/UK/US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May said it was always clear there would come a critical point in Brexit negotiations and now is the time to hold nerve, while there were separate reports the UK cabinet is said to give PM May&#39;s Brexit plan 2 weeks for progress. (Newswires/The Sun)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK PM May is to meet US President Trump on Wednesday to discuss Brexit and a post-Brexit trade deal, according to a British official. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the UK, EU migrants will not be given preferential treatment after Brexit and the number coming to the UK will fall significantly under Government plans. (Telegraph)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU trade commissioner Malmstrom said EU talks with the US are still in an exploratory phase. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Swedish PM Lofven has been defeated in a confidence vote by Parliament; as expected. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Italian Government Source said that the ruling coalition are willing to keep deficit/GDP below 2%. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GEOPOLITICS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign Policy Head Mogherini said EU will set up a legal entity to facilitate legitimate financial transactions to allow continued trade with Iran. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump and South Korea&#39;s Moon discussed the continuation of sanctions against North Korea. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CENTRAL BANKS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Norges Bank&#39;s Olsen says that rate hikes can be expected to be gradual and is a response to the solid activity in the Norwegian economy. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE&#39;s Vlieghe said the QE unwind need not have a material effect on yield curve shape or economy if well communicated and gradual, and that more communication from the BoE can be expected as QE unwind approaches. He added that they are not at the point yet that the BoE would change its smooth Brexit assumptions, says his own central forecast of 1-2 rate hikes per year is broadly right assuming wage and productivity growth picks up. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ECB&#39;s Praet stated that there was nothing new in ECB Draghi&#39;s speech yesterday. It will take months before higher wages lift inflation and things are moving slowly but in the right direction. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EQUITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>European equities have started the day higher with the FTSE MIB the marked outperformer as reports suggest the Italian Government are set to announce a deficit/GDP under 2%. Next are leading the gains in the FTSE and the Stoxx 600 after the UK retailer reported inspiring earnings and upwardly revised FY guidance for profits by GBP 10mln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evonik shares are languishing close to the foot of the Stoxx 600 after RAG-Stiftung reduced its holding in the co. to 64.3%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The energy sector is extending on the gains seen yesterday and is the outperforming sector off the back of rising oil prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY - The index is clinging to recovery gains just above the 94.000 level as the clock begins to tick down to Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC meeting, but largely due to dovish/bearish impulses from the BoJ and resultant JPY weakness vs the Greenback alongside other major counterparts on a cross basis. Indeed, Usd/Jpy looks poised to probe 113.00 as Governor Kuroda effectively endorsed further upside potential given ongoing easy policy in Japan vs more normalisation in the US. Technically, 113.24&nbsp; forms the 200 WMA, and the 2018 high so far is 113.40, assuming the big figure is surpassed and that could be down to the Fed via September&rsquo;s SEP and/or the tone of the accompanying statement given that another 25 bp hike seems baked in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR - The Pound is in pole position among G10s, partly due to the aforementioned lack of yen for the Jpy and perhaps positive sounding Brexit deal vibes from German Chancellor Merkel amidst all the divergence at home. Cable is retesting offers/resistance around 1.3150 and bids/support circa 0.8950 vs the single currency as ECB&rsquo;s Praet plays down hawkish inflation comments from President Draghi, or at least perceptions and the rather &lsquo;vigorous&rsquo; market reaction. Eur/Usd has eased back towards 1.1750 vs 1.1800+ yesterday, and from a chart perspective has retreated through a key Fib again (1.1780).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/SEK - The Kiwi and Krona are both holding up well around 0.6650-30 vs the Usd and 10.3430-3120 vs the Eur respectively, ahead of the RNBZ policy meeting overnight and after Sweden&rsquo;s no confidence vote against the PM. NZ rates are widely, if not unanimously seen on hold yet again, but firmer than forecast GDP data may warrant attention via less chance of a cut from a rise in easing prospects last time. Meanwhile, the demise of Swedish PM Lofven was also largely anticipated, and he remains defiant in defeat or at least hopeful that he can cross political divides to form a new Government and return to power. Back down under, NZ trade data later may also provide some impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/CHF - All extending losses vs the Greenback, or perhaps shouldering the weight of the Dollar&rsquo;s partial revival, with the Loonie slipping further from recent highs to circa 1.2960 and still mainly contingent on NAFTA instead of still bid/rising crude prices, the Aud capped below 0.7250 and hampered by the lack of US-China trade talks, and the Franc underperforming around 0.9650 and down through 1.1350 vs the Eur amidst latest Italian fiscal reports suggesting compliance with EU budget rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post-Praet recovery gains in Bunds relatively short-lived (back above 158.00, but not beyond the 158.21 Eurex peak vs 157.85 at worst), as Italian bonds rebound further and test 127.00+ levels in wake of pretty comfortable CTZ and BTPei offerings and after latest Government assurances that the 2019 budget shortfall will be capped below 2%. In fact, peripheral paper may also be gleaning more encouragement that core debt from attempts by Praet to manage expectations following the fright from Draghi inflation comments on Monday, while Gilts are sitting just off fresh Liffe lows of 120.37 (-33 ticks) amidst BoE Vlieghe&rsquo;s remarks that could be construed as hawkish vs the MPC consensus given his preference for 1-2 hikes per year vs a single adjustment flagged as recently as August. On that note, Short Sterling futures have slipped a tad further to as much as 4 ticks below par, even though he qualified his views by adding wage price conditionality. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are rooted near overnight session lows ahead of more supply, and the FOMC tomorrow with uncertainty over the latest dot-plots and other SEP forecasts, plus the tone of the policy statement and Fed chair Powell&rsquo;s press conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oil market is adding to the gains seen yesterday, with the fossil fuel hitting over 4 year highs, and Brent breaking USD 82.00 to the upside in European trade as the production-shy rhetoric from OPEC remains fresh in traders minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, gold is uneventful and trading within an exceedingly thin range of USD 3/oz with the yellow metal consolidating around the USD 1200/oz, as traders look ahead to tomorrows anticipated hike from the FOMC.

        "content": "<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The index is clinging to recovery gains just above the 94.000 level as the clock begins to tick down to Wednesday&rsquo;s FOMC meeting, but largely due to dovish/bearish impulses from the BoJ and resultant JPY weakness vs the Greenback alongside other major counterparts on a cross basis. Indeed, Usd/Jpy looks poised to probe 113.00 as Governor Kuroda effectively endorsed further upside potential given ongoing easy policy in Japan vs more normalisation in the US. Technically, 113.24&nbsp; forms the 200 WMA, and the 2018 high so far is 113.40, assuming the big figure is surpassed and that could be down to the Fed via September&rsquo;s SEP and/or the tone of the accompanying statement given that another 25 bp hike seems baked in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/EUR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pound is in pole position among G10s, partly due to the aforementioned lack of yen for the Jpy and perhaps positive sounding Brexit deal vibes from German Chancellor Merkel amidst all the divergence at home. Cable is retesting offers/resistance around 1.3150 and bids/support circa 0.8950 vs the single currency as ECB&rsquo;s Praet plays down hawkish inflation comments from President Draghi, or at least perceptions and the rather &lsquo;vigorous&rsquo; market reaction. Eur/Usd has eased back towards 1.1750 vs 1.1800+ yesterday, and from a chart perspective has retreated through a key Fib again (1.1780).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/SEK &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kiwi and Krona are both holding up well around 0.6650-30 vs the Usd and 10.3430-3120 vs the Eur respectively, ahead of the RNBZ policy meeting overnight and after Sweden&rsquo;s no confidence vote against the PM. NZ rates are widely, if not unanimously seen on hold yet again, but firmer than forecast GDP data may warrant attention via less chance of a cut from a rise in easing prospects last time. Meanwhile, the demise of Swedish PM Lofven was also largely anticipated, and he remains defiant in defeat or at least hopeful that he can cross political divides to form a new Government and return to power. Back down under, NZ trade data later may also provide some impetus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/AUD/CHF &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All extending losses vs the Greenback, or perhaps shouldering the weight of the Dollar&rsquo;s partial revival, with the Loonie slipping further from recent highs to circa 1.2960 and still mainly contingent on NAFTA instead of still bid/rising crude prices, the Aud capped below 0.7250 and hampered by the lack of US-China trade talks, and the Franc underperforming around 0.9650 and down through 1.1350 vs the Eur amidst latest Italian fiscal reports suggesting compliance with EU budget rules.</p>\r\n",

Bunds have also bounced off worst levels to tentatively reclaim 158.00+ status, just, and perhaps partially on tech grounds as support around 157.87 just held in earlier. Note also, EU stocks have been choppy following a firm start, but on the flip-side Italian BTPs continue to grind higher towards 127.00, with little sign of any pre-auction concession, thus far at least.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (+0.1%) losses were led by weakness in the financial sector while Nikkei 225 (Unch) was choppy in lock-step with an indecisive currency. The Shanghai Composite (-0.8%) underperformed on the return from the long weekend and took its first opportunity to react to China&rsquo;s cancellation of trade discussions, while the PBoC conducted a net liquidity drain and China was also reportedly to create a national system to monitor government spending. Elsewhere, Hang Seng and KOSPI are closed due to public holidays. Finally, 10yr JGBs were marginally lower in which prices tested the 150.00 level to the downside coinciding with weakness in T-notes, while the BoJ&rsquo;s Rinban announcement was for a relatively reserved JPY 475bln.</p>\r\n",
