        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP â€“ 3 Aug 2018: China steps up trade retaliation; PBOC intervenes in yuan; NFP headline miss",
        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAP-SHOT: Equities, Treasuries, crude, dollar.<br />* REAR-VIEW: NFP headline miss, revisions encouraging; PBOC intervenes to stem yuan slide; China ramps up trade retaliation.<br />* NEXT WEEK: RBA (Tues), China trade (Weds), RBNZ (Thurs), China CPI (Thurs), US/Japan trade talks (Thurs), Japan GDP (Fri), Canada labor data (Fri).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* PBOC: </strong>China&rsquo;s central bank raised the reserve requirement on FX forwards trading from 0% to 20%, reversing last September&rsquo;s move the other way (note: this move should not be mistaken for an RRR rate cut). The new requirement will be effective from 6 August. The PBOC added that it would take counter cyclical measures to keep FX markets stable, based on market conditions, reiterating that the yuan will be kept &ldquo;basically stable&rdquo;. Analysts said that, given last September&rsquo;s move was designed to stem the yuan&rsquo;s appreciation, the latest measures are an effort to stem the recent slide. The immediate result was a strengthening of the yuan, weakening of the USD, and equity futures bounced in the pre-market, as traders perceived the news as risk-friendly, with China appearing to make a concession to the US amid trade tensions; some, however, suggest it was merely a move to keep its currency stable, in line with its guidance. That sentiment, however, was short-lived (See trade section, below).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE: </strong>China announced a list of potential retaliatory tariff threats it would impose on approximately $60bln of imports of US goods, across a range of product types, including aircraft, semiconductors, chemicals, agricultural products, auto parts, and commodities. The tariffs would have variable rates from 5% to 25%. China&rsquo;s Commerce Ministry also urged the US to take practical measures to relax export control to China. NEC director Kudlow, responding to the measures, said the moves were weak, and there were some signs that China now wishes to talk, although other officials suggested that there had been very little contact with China in recent days. Elsewhere, Kudlow said an announcement with the EU could be coming up, and he also said that the US will likely have some positive news on Mexico, with an announcement to be made within the next month. Mexico&rsquo;s economy minister Guarjardo said that Mexico is ready to move into finishing up most of the issues between the US and Mexico next week, and repeated his optimism of achieving a deal by the end of the month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US JOBS REPORT: </strong>Headline payrolls missed expectations at 157k in July (consensus 193k), though net revisions to previous data was a chunky +57k, with the jobless rate dropping to 3.9% (prev. 4.0%) and the U6 measure of unemployment falling by 0.3ppts to 7.5%. Average hourly earnings were in line with expectations (unchanged 2.7% YY, 0.3% MM, the latter helped along by favourable rounding). &ldquo;The swing in payroll growth from 248k in June to 157k in July looks more like noise than signal, but we can&#39;t be absolutely sure, given the clear dip in the ISM non-manufacturing employment index in recent months, following the initial of tariffs,&rdquo; Pantheon Macroeconomics writes, &ldquo;other employment indicators, like JOLTS and the NFIB survey, remain very strong, though, so for now we&#39;re happy to stick to the idea that the trend remains 200K-plus.&rdquo;Pantheon suggests that the swing between June and July data is likely a result of seasonal adjustments around the end of the academic year. Elsewhere, participation was unchanged at 62.9%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NON-MANUFACTURING ISM: </strong>The survey&rsquo;s headline missed expectations, coming in at 55.7 (consensus 58.6). Business activity also disappointed, as did new orders; employment and prices rose. &ldquo;Consistent with Wednesday&rsquo;s manufacturing report, respondent commentary reflected trade-related uncertainties weighing on otherwise solid demand,&rdquo; Oxford Economics wrote. &ldquo;One respondent in the professional services sector noted general optimism on the labor market and economic activity were &lsquo;tempered by tariff issues with China and the European Union.&rsquo; Another in the retail space added &lsquo;business is up overall, but a lot of questions loom over the rest of the year,&rsquo; including the impact of tariffs on business&rsquo; cost of goods.&rdquo; Oxford Economics adds that with the prices paid index holding above the elevated 60-mark for most of the past year, it continues to see evidence of margin pressure for businesses that will force a greater focus on cost containment in the months ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>Following the BOE&rsquo;s warnings on Brexit after its policy meeting (again), BOE governor Carney said the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was &ldquo;uncomfortably high&rdquo;, and argued that it was in the interest of the UK and the EU to have a &ldquo;long&rdquo; transitional deal, reiterating again that a no deal Brexit was &ldquo;highly undesirable&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.5% at 2840, NDX +0.3% at 7395, DJI at +0.5% at 25462. </strong>SECTORS: energy -0.5%, materials +0.9%, industrials +0.1%, cons disc +0.3%, cons stap +1.2%, healthcare +0.6%, financials +0.5%, IT +0.3%, telecoms +0.9%, utilities +1.0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>In thin trade with only 500k ES traded by midday in the US, equity futures were initially boosted as the PBoC increasing its required reserve ratio back to 20% from 0%, which strengthened the CNY and hit USD across all pairs, and a boost to stocks; this was initially seen as a move to ease trade war effects between the US and China. However, the move was undone as China released its potential retaliation list of tariffs on up to $60bln of US goods. However, the moves were very limited, with ES patrolling a 10-point range in US hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Kraft Heinz (KHC) reported its figures Friday morning which beat on both the top and bottom lines. KHC were also boosted after reports in NY Post which stated the food manufacturer was in preliminary talks with Campbell Soup (CPB), according to people familiar with the matter. The NY Post reported that KHC is looking for a bargain, and will likely not pay much of a premium for CPB. DISH (DISH) beat on both top and bottom lines, which placed it as one of the outperformers on Friday. DISH&rsquo;s earnings cool gave a lift to the shares throughout the day as the co. is on track to finish its wireless network on time, and the Chairman stated they are confident its Internet of Things network will be accepted by the FCC. CBS (CBS) reported AMC on Thursday with little fireworks as EPS beat by 1c and revenues beat by $10mln. Alphabet (GOOGL) are reportedly struggling to regain entry into China due to ongoing trade tensions, and it is also being investigated by the Turkish antitrust board. During hours, WSJ reported that Australia&rsquo;s Amcor is in late stage talks with Bemis (BMS) where the shares spiked 6% before resuming and extending to intraday highs of 13%. IBM (IBM) outperformed the DJI following unconfirmed source reports that Carl Icahn is building a stake in the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (U8) SETTLES $0.47 LOWER AT $68.49; BRENT (V8) SETTLES $0.24 LOWER AT $73.21. </strong>Trade war tensions are making their presence felt in the crude space, with Beijing reportedly rejecting a request from the US to cut imports of Iranian crude (though there seems to be a suggestion that China will not ramp up its purchases of Iranian crude, as other nations cut their imports in response to US sanctions), while China&rsquo;s Unipec suspended imports of US crude. &ldquo;A key negative risk for oil has been that lost Iranian imports into US allies would be offset by increased buying from China. With well in excess of 1mb/d of spare capacity in China&rsquo;s teapot refiners, the risk has been that China could easily absorb additional volumes from Iran,&rdquo; UBS wrote. &ldquo;Now that it appears this will not be happening, risk for oil is very much skewed to the upside as we await production data that will show whether OPEC+ (and Saudi Arabia in particular) can add enough production to keep the market adequately supplied when Iranian barrels come out of global supply.&rdquo; Elsewhere, OPEC sources reported that Saudi Arabia crude output stood at 10.290mln BPD in July (vs. 10.488mln pumped in June), with July crude supply at 10.38mln BPD. Baker Hughes reported oil rigs fell by 2 in the week to 859 (cut rigs for the second week in three), gas rigs -3 to 183, total rigs -4 to 1044.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES SETTLE 9 TICKS HIGHER AT 119-19+: </strong>There were further reports of short-covering after traders were positioned for a better NFP headline based on the ADP data released on Wednesday, IGM said. The complex was also buoyed by a ramping up of trade tensions (this time, from the Chinese side). The net result was a slightly flatter curve, with major curve spreads little changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CNH: </strong>Ramped up US vs China tariff threats prompted yet more Cny and Cnh depreciation over the course of the week, and again partly by official design as the PBoC continued to fix the onshore mid point vs the Usd higher. However, 6.9000 appears to be the tolerance level, as local banks were reportedly drafted in to stem the tide and the Central Bank backed this up by re-instigating the 20% reserve requirement on FX Forwards that was removed last year (incidentally) to curb a Renminbi rally. The Yuan rebounded further in response to circa 6.8300 before Beijing followed up verbal retaliation to confirmation that the US is looking to raise import taxes on a further Usd200 bn goods to 25% from 10% with a list of $60 bn US items that could be subject to between 5% and 25% levies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* DXY: </strong>Fuelled by the latest trade war developments and fanned to some extent by an upbeat FOMC that underscored market expectations for hikes in September and December, the index and broad Dollar remains on track for net gains this week. The DXY has backed off from best levels of 95.372, but remains above 95.000 vs 94.659 early Monday and a low of 94.162. Note, NFP did not really live up to its top-notch data status even though the headline payroll gain was much lower than forecast as back month upgrades offset and average earnings were broadly in line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* AUD, NZD: </strong>Both largely at the whim of US-China and wider global trade developments, with intermittent deviations from that overall pattern/trend for antipodean data (like strong Aussie retail sales and trade vs weak NZ jobless rate and wages), but with the Aud ultimately outperforming the Kiwi or vice-versa as the cross rebounds firmly above 1.0900 and Aud/Usd recovers from circa 0.7350 lows towards 0.7400 (where another large 1 bn option expiry lay), but Nzd/Usd flounders below 0.6750 vs 0.7390 and 0.6790 at the start of the week respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GBP, JPY: </strong>The BoE and BoJ both stuck to the script in terms of widely anticipated policy changes, but with very different results on the Pound and Yen, as Cable lost 1.3100 and 1.3000 status due to dovish policy guidance after the 25 bp hike and Governor Carney&rsquo;s discernible discomfort on heightened risks of a no deal Brexit. Indeed, he said that the MPC could reverse course if needed, while emphasising gradual and limited further tightening to a likely peak around 1.5% at a &frac14; point pace per annum. Conversely, the BoJ tweaked its YCC to allow more flexibility around curve targets (ie upside in 10 years, although the new band is symmetrical), boosting the Jpy from 112.00+ lows vs the Usd back towards 111.50 and now nearer 111.00 after a disappointing US services ISM and more reciprocal US-China tariff actions and words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EUR, CAD: </strong>Similar contrasting fortunes, as the single currency has retreated almost 2 big figures from 1.1745 to circa 1.1560 and through a key 1.1575 Fib that had been supporting on a mixture of US-Eurozone yield/CB differentials and risk aversion. However, the Loonie derive some support from underlying crude/commodity prices, Canadian data (like trade) and vicariously via positive news on the NAFTA front even though not party to latest negotiations between the US and Mexico. Usd/Cad below 1.3000 vs almost 1.3100 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EMFX: </strong>Aside from the Yuan swings, EMs have been under the cosh for the most part, with the exception of the Peso on rising hopes of a NAFTA deal in the offing and a marked improvement in Mexican consumer confidence. The Lira sunk to fresh 5.1100+ record lows vs the Usd as Turkey was hit by more US sanctions but recovered some lost ground after meetings between officials from the 2 countries were said to have been positive and CPI data was not as strong as expected. Meanwhile, the Rand was undermined by more domestic political issues and investor angst after the ANC altered SA&rsquo;s constitution to permit land appropriation without financial consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WEEK IN FOCUS PREVIEW: </strong>Monday: German Factory Orders; Tuesday: RBA Rate Decision, German Industrial Production, US JOLTs; Wednesday: China Trade Balance; Thursday: RBNZ Rate Decision, China CPI, US PPI, US and Japan to hold bilateral trade talks; Friday: Japan GDP, Norway CPI, Swedish CPI, UK GDP, US CPI, Canadian Labour Market. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19783/download\">Click here to read full report.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CENTRAL BANK WEEKLY: </strong>RBNZ: Dovish hold expected on Thursday; RBA: No fireworks anticipated at Tuesday policy meeting; BOJ REVIEW: A covert rate hike?; BOE REVIEW: Raised rates 25bps, but it is in no hurry to go again; FED REVIEW: Nothing new, to gradually lift rates; BCB REVIEW: Flags risks to inflation; BANXICO REVIEW: Repeats growth risks to the downside; RBI REVIEW: Hikes but maintains neutral stance. <a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/19784/download\">Click here to read full report.</a></p>\r\n",

With well in excess of 1mb/d of spare capacity in China&iacute;s teapot refiners, the risk has been that China could easily absorb additional volumes from Iran,&rdquo; UBS wrote. &ldquo;Now that it appears this will not be happening, risk for oil is very much skewed to the upside as we await production data that will show whether OPEC+ (and Saudi Arabia in particular) can add enough production to keep the market adequately supplied when Iranian barrels come out of global supply.&rdquo; Elsewhere, OPEC sources reported that Saudi Arabia crude output stood at 10.290mln BPD in July (vs. 10.488mln pumped in June), with July crude supply at 10.38mln BPD.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>YUAN</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ramped up US vs China tariff threats prompted yet more Cny and Cnh depreciation over the course of the week, and again partly by official design as the PBoC continued to fix the onshore mid point vs the Usd higher. However, 6.9000 appears to be the tolerance level, as local banks were reportedly drafted in to stem the tide and the Central Bank backed this up by re-instigating the 20% reserve requirement on FX Forwards that was removed last year (incidentally) to curb a Renminbi rally. The Yuans rebounded further in response to circa 6.8300 before Beijing followed up verbal retaliation to confirmation that the US is looking to raise import taxes on a further Usd200 bn goods to 25% from 10% with a list of $60 bn US items that could be subject to between 5% and 25% levies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fuelled by the latest trade war developments and fanned to some extent by an upbeat FOMC that underscored market expectations for hikes in September and December, the index and broad Dollar remains on track for net gains this week. The DXY has backed off from best levels of 95.372, but remains above 95.000 vs 94.659 early Monday and a low of 94.162. Note, NFP did not really live up to its top-notch data status even though the headline payroll gain was much lower than forecast as back month upgrades offset and average earnings were broadly in line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD/NZD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both largely at the whim of US-China and wider global trade developments, with intermittent deviations from that overall pattern/trend for antipodean data (like strong Aussie retail sales and trade vs weak NZ jobless rate and wages), but with the Aud ultimately outperforming the Kiwi or vice-versa as the cross rebounds firmly above 1.0900 and Aud/Usd recovers from circa 0.7350 lows towards 0.7400 (where another large 1 bn option expiry lay), but Nzd/Usd flounders below 0.6750 vs 0.7390 and 0.6790 at the start of the week respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP/JPY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BoE and BoJ both stuck to the script in terms of widely anticipated policy changes, but with very different results on the Pound and Yen, as Cable lost 1.3100 and 1.3000 status due to dovish policy guidance after the 25 bp hike and Governor Carney&rsquo;s discernible discomfort on heightened risks of a no deal Brexit. Indeed, he said that the MPC could reverse course if needed, while emphasising gradual and limited further tightening to a likely peak around 1.5% at a &frac14; point pace per annum. Conversely, the BoJ tweaked its YCC to allow more flexibility around curve targets (ie upside in 10 years, although the new band is symmetrical), boosting the Jpy from 112.00+ lows vs the Usd back towards 111.50 and now nearer 111.00 after a disappointing US services ISM and more reciprocal US-China tariff actions and words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/CAD</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar contrasting fortunes, as the single currency has retreated almost 2 big figures from 1.1745 to circa 1.1560 and through a key 1.1575 Fib that had been supporting on a mixture of US-Eurozone yield/CB differentials and risk aversion. However, the Loonie derive some support from underlying crude/commodity prices, Canadian data (like trade) and vicariously via positive news on the NAFTA front even though not party to latest negotiations between the US and Mexico. Usd/Cad below 1.3000 vs almost 1.3100 at one stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EM &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the Yuan swings, EMs have been under the cosh for the most part, with the exception of the Peso on rising hopes of a NAFTA deal in the offing and a marked improvement in Mexican consumer confidence. The Lira sunk to fresh 5.1100+ record lows vs the Usd as Turkey was hit by more US sanctions but recovered some lost ground after meetings between officials from the 2 countries were said to have been positive and CPI data was not as strong as expected. Meanwhile, the Rand was undermined by more domestic political issues and investor angst after the ANC altered SA&rsquo;s constitution to permit land appropriation without financial consideration.</p>\r\n",

The AEX (+0.5%) is the outperforming bourse buoyed by the news of Heineken&rsquo;s (+2.3%) USD 3.1bln tie-up with China Resource Beer. The DAX (+0.5%) is also performing well after a positive earnings report from Allianz (+0.7%), but the bourse is finding resistance at its 100DMA of 12,573.54.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBS (+3.0) is up after news within their positive earnings report that they are set to pay their first dividend in over a decade. William Hill are down over 7% after the betting co. reported a pre-tax loss for H1 as a result of the new laws on betting terminals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts corrected higher in line with pre-Liffe open indications, and after a brief wobble from an initial 122.47 print vs Thursday&rsquo;s 122.19 close, the 10 year benchmark climbed to 122.62 for a 43 tick gain on the day, while Bunds inched closer to 162.00 at 161.99 (+73 ticks) before topping out as BTPs continue to try and find a base (123.30 latest, -217 ticks). No real reaction to a considerably weaker than expected UK services PMI, with yesterday&rsquo;s BoE tightening somewhat overshadowing the release and Governor Carney underscoring again the &lsquo;gradual and limited&rsquo; outlook for rates by validating market pricing for a 1.5% peak. Accordingly, Short Sterling futures have nudged up a bit further along the curve. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are mildly firmer but off overnight highs and the curve is gently steeper ahead of NFP followed by the services PMI and ISM, with average earnings and price components more market moving than the headline prints for the next major move in yields as the 10-year retreats below 3% again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has extended its post-BoE declines as Governor Carney underlined benign if not outright dovish policy guidance during a BBC radio interview and also expressed discomfort about growing risk of a no deal Brexit. Cable dropped below 1.3000 in response and was hardly helped by a relatively big UK services PMI miss, but stopped just short of the 2018 base around 1.2960 at 1.2975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The other G10 laggard or underperformer with the Kiwi unable to resist overall Usd strength (DXY &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; above 95.000 ahead of the US jobs data and not far from its 95.656 ytd peak at 95.372 before easing back amidst reports of Usd/Cnh intervention at 6.9000). Nzd/Usd has breached 0.6750 to test bids at 0.6725.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/AUD - All holding up relatively well again vs the Greenback as the Loonie latches on to positive NAFTA vibes, even if not directly involved in negotiations between the US and Mexico, and contains losses ahead of 1.3050, while the Franc meanders within a very tight 0.9965-50 range after broadly in line with consensus Swiss CPI data and the Aud also derives some support from firmer than forecast Aussie retail sales overnight to keep its head above 0.7350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY - The single currency has also relinquished another big figure level vs the Usd and has seriously tested a key 1.1575 Fib after mostly softer than expected Eurozone services PMIs and retail sales. For the record, 1.1510 is the low so far this year. Usd/Jpy extremely restrained between 111.80-60 and flanked by hefty option expiries at 112.00 (1.8 bn) and 110.90-111.00 (1.3 bn), plus 1 bn from 111.40-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - The Lira slumped to fresh all time lows vs the Usd yet again (5.1125) before gleaning a degree of comfort from not so inflated CPI readings and reports that a meet between US Secretary of State Pompeo and Turkey&rsquo;s Foreign Minister was constructive &ndash; Usd/Try currently around 5.0800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - As noted above, the Dollar remains in the ascendency, albeit off best levels, but NFP will likely determine the next big move, and especially wages after Wednesday&rsquo;s broadly upbeat assessments of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both WTI and Brent are seeing mild profit taking ahead of the weeks end, with WTI breaking through its 50DMA to the downside in early European trade, currently trading at USD 68.59, with news that China&#39;s Unipec is suspending imports of US crude oil on growing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington failing to offer support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is essentially flat, with traders holding off ahead of the US employment report later in the day, but is languishing around a 1 year low, with the yellow metal heading for its 4th weekly loss. Silver is also heading for its 8th weekly decline amid trade tensions, and set for its longest consecutive decline since late 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC July crude output up 340k BPD at 32.66mln BPD, compliance is at 105%, Saudi Arabian output near an all-time high, Kuwaiti, UAE and Iraqi output at its highest since December 2016, Iran at its lowest since January 2017, as according to Platts.</p>\r\n",

The DAX (+0.5%) is also performing well after a positive earnings report from Allianz (+0.7%), but the bourse is finding resistance at its 100DMA of 12,573.54.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBS (+3.0) is up after news within their positive earnings report that they are set to pay their first dividend in over a decade. William Hill are down over 7% after the betting co. reported a pre-tax loss for H1 as a result of the new laws on betting terminals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FIXED INCOME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gilts corrected higher in line with pre-Liffe open indications, and after a brief wobble from an initial 122.47 print vs Thursday&rsquo;s 122.19 close, the 10 year benchmark climbed to 122.62 for a 43 tick gain on the day, while Bunds inched closer to 162.00 at 161.99 (+73 ticks) before topping out as BTPs continue to try and find a base (123.30 latest, -217 ticks). No real reaction to a considerably weaker than expected UK services PMI, with yesterday&rsquo;s BoE tightening somewhat overshadowing the release and Governor Carney underscoring again the &lsquo;gradual and limited&rsquo; outlook for rates by validating market pricing for a 1.5% peak. Accordingly, Short Sterling futures have nudged up a bit further along the curve. Elsewhere, US Treasuries are mildly firmer but off overnight highs and the curve is gently steeper ahead of NFP followed by the services PMI and ISM, with average earnings and price components more market moving than the headline prints for the next major move in yields as the 10-year retreats below 3% again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - The Pound has extended its post-BoE declines as Governor Carney underlined benign if not outright dovish policy guidance during a BBC radio interview and also expressed discomfort about growing risk of a no deal Brexit. Cable dropped below 1.3000 in response and was hardly helped by a relatively big UK services PMI miss, but stopped just short of the 2018 base around 1.2960 at 1.2975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD - The other G10 laggard or underperformer with the Kiwi unable to resist overall Usd strength (DXY &lsquo;comfortably&rsquo; above 95.000 ahead of the US jobs data and not far from its 95.656 ytd peak at 95.372 before easing back amidst reports of Usd/Cnh intervention at 6.9000). Nzd/Usd has breached 0.6750 to test bids at 0.6725.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/CHF/AUD - All holding up relatively well again vs the Greenback as the Loonie latches on to positive NAFTA vibes, even if not directly involved in negotiations between the US and Mexico, and contains losses ahead of 1.3050, while the Franc meanders within a very tight 0.9965-50 range after broadly in line with consensus Swiss CPI data and the Aud also derives some support from firmer than forecast Aussie retail sales overnight to keep its head above 0.7350.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR/JPY - The single currency has also relinquished another big figure level vs the Usd and has seriously tested a key 1.1575 Fib after mostly softer than expected Eurozone services PMIs and retail sales. For the record, 1.1510 is the low so far this year. Usd/Jpy extremely restrained between 111.80-60 and flanked by hefty option expiries at 112.00 (1.8 bn) and 110.90-111.00 (1.3 bn), plus 1 bn from 111.40-50.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TRY - The Lira slumped to fresh all time lows vs the Usd yet again (5.1125) before gleaning a degree of comfort from not so inflated CPI readings and reports that a meet between US Secretary of State Pompeo and Turkey&rsquo;s Foreign Minister was constructive &ndash; Usd/Try currently around 5.0800.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>USD - As noted above, the Dollar remains in the ascendency, albeit off best levels, but NFP will likely determine the next big move, and especially wages after Wednesday&rsquo;s broadly upbeat assessments of the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both WTI and Brent are seeing mild profit taking ahead of the weeks end, with WTI breaking through its 50DMA to the downside in early European trade, currently trading at USD 68.59, with news that China&#39;s Unipec is suspending imports of US crude oil on growing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington failing to offer support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the metals scope, Gold is essentially flat, with traders holding off ahead of the US employment report later in the day, but is languishing around a 1 year low, with the yellow metal heading for its 4th weekly loss. Silver is also heading for its 8th weekly decline amid trade tensions, and set for its longest consecutive decline since late 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OPEC July crude output up 340k BPD at 32.66mln BPD, compliance is at 105%, Saudi Arabian output near an all-time high, Kuwaiti, UAE and Iraqi output at its highest since December 2016, Iran at its lowest since January 2017, as according to Platts.</p>\r\n",

No real reaction to a considerably weaker than expected UK services PMI, with yesterday&rsquo;s BoE tightening somewhat overshadowing the release and Governor Carney underscoring again the &lsquo;gradual and limited&rsquo; outlook for rates by validating market pricing for a 1.5% peak. Accordingly, Short Sterling futures have nudged up a bit further along the curve, while Sterling has weakened further as he also warned that the risk of a no deal Brexit has increased markedly, although that still not seen as the most likely outcome. Cable has now lost 1.3000+ status and eyeing the circa 1.2958 ytd low, while Eur/Usd has tested key Fib support around 1.1575 and briefly dipped below, but not breached the level convincingly.</p>\r\n",

Looking at early Eurex price action, Bunds were marked up a modest 11 ticks initially to 161.37 vs Thursday&rsquo;s 161.26 close, but have gathered momentum inversely with BTPs to hit 161.69 (+43 ticks) vs 124.54 (-93 ticks) for the latter.

ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) both opened higher in which tech names in Australia revelled in the strength of their US peers and Apple&rsquo;s historical feat, while Tokyo trade remained earnings-oriented. Sentiment then slightly deteriorated as China entered the fray and Caixin Services PMI missed estimates to add to the nation&rsquo;s streak of disappointing PMI releases for July. The weak data and ongoing trade concerns weighed on Hang Seng (-0.2%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.1%) from the open, although the latter has since recovered to trade relatively flat. Finally, 10yr JGBs were flat in the first signs of stability after the BoJ&rsquo;s more flexible policy approach earlier this week, while the Rinban announcement also failed to spur price action as the BoJ kept purchases of 5yr-10yr JGBs inline with yesterday&rsquo;s unscheduled announcement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations for a net weekly drain of CNY 210bln vs. last week&#39;s CNY 370bln net drain. (Newswires)<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.8322 (Prev. 6.7942)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese Caixin Services PMI Jul 52.8 vs. Exp. 53.5 (Prev. 53.9). (Newswires)<br />Chinese Caixin Composite PMI (Jul) 52.3 (Prev. 53.0)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoJ minutes from June 14th-15th meeting stated momentum to achieving price target was being maintained and that most members viewed BoJ would continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2% as long as it was necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. In addition, some members said must continue to carefully assess effects of low rates on banks, while one member suggested they must scrutinize positive and negative side effects of policy considering that it will take a while to reach inflation goal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK/EU</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BoE Governor Carney said that one rate hike a year for the next few years will more or less get inflation back to the 2% target over the horizon, while Carney also commented the BoE is prepared to cut interest rates back again, depending upon how Brexit negotiations go. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Institute of Directions has called on the UK government to speed up guidance on what companies should expect in the event of a no-deal Brexit. A survey of 800 business leaders showed less than a third made any Brexit contingency plans. (BBC)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU Chief Negotiator Barnier has signalled that Brussels is prepared to compromise on its demands for a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets were relatively quiet overnight in which the DXY held steady above the 95.00 level as most of its major counterparts took a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s broad retreat against the greenback. As such, EUR/USD remained near a 1-month low beneath the 1.1600 handle and GBP/USD continued to eye 1.3000 after its failure to launch despite the BoE rate hike, as the central bank also flagged Brexit risks and stressed any future rate rises are likely to be gradual and limited. Elsewhere, USD/JPY was choppy and AUD/USD found support from better than expected Retail Sales data, although this was made brief as CNY fell to levels last seen in May 2017 after the PBoC resumed its devaluation of the reference rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Retail Sales (Jun) M/M 0.4% vs. Exp. 0.3% (Prev. 0.4%). (Newswires)<br />Australian Retail Sales (Q2) Q/Q 1.2% vs. Exp. 0.8% (Prev. 0.2%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commodities were steady with WTI crude futures sideways overnight a sit takes a break from the prior day&rsquo;s advances in which prices found support at USD 67.00/bbl and eventually reclaimed USD 69.00/bbl. Elsewhere, gold remained subdued as the greenback held firm and with participants tentative ahead of the upcoming US NFP jobs data later, while copper also traded flat amid the indecisive risk tone in the Asia-Pac region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were higher and the curve modestly bull-steepened on Thursday. There was some selling action after a weak JGB auction overnight, and after the BOE&rsquo;s rate decision, the complex also found sellers in the first instance. Analysts at IGM suggested that there was some short-covering ahead of Friday&rsquo;s payrolls data, while the belly of the curve was bolstered by a block trade in the five-year space. US 10YR T-notes settled higher by 5 ticks at 119-10+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US announced final duties on imported uncoated groundwood paper from Canada which is used for newspapers, while Canadian government said it is disappointed by the duties and noted that tariffs could hurt smaller communities and cost jobs at local papers. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico Economy Minister Guajardo said NAFTA talks with USTR will cover all outstanding issues in trade talks, while he added there will not be a deal on autos until all NAFTA issues are resolved.

        "content": "<p>Asia equity markets trade mixed as the momentum from US, where most major indices gained and tech outperformed as Apple became the first ever to reach USD 1tln in market cap, was eventually dampened ahead of today&rsquo;s NFP jobs figures and a further PMI miss from China. ASX 200 (-0.1%) and Nikkei 225 (+0.1%) were both initially higher with tech names in Australia revelling in the strength of their US peers and Apple&rsquo;s historical feat, while Tokyo trade remains earnings-oriented with Suzuki surging on increased profits for Q1. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (-0.3%) and Shanghai Comp. (-0.5%) are downbeat due to the ongoing trade concerns and after the PBoC drained another CNY 210bln this week. In addition, China Caixin Services missed estimates and Composite PMI data weakened, which added to the nation&rsquo;s streak of disappointing PMI releases for July.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets are relatively quiet overnight with the DXY holding steady above the 95.00 level as most its major counterparts take a breather from the prior day&rsquo;s broad retreat against the greenback. This has kept EUR/USD near a 1-month low beneath the 1.1600 handle and GBP/USD continues to eye 1.3000 after its failure to launch despite the BoE rate hike, as the central bank also flagged Brexit risks and stressed any future rate rises are likely to be gradual and limited. Elsewhere, USD/JPY is choppy and AUD/USD found support from better than expected Retail Sales data, although this was made brief as CNY fell to levels last seen in May 2017 after the PBoC resumed its devaluation of the reference rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are flat in the first signs of stability after the BoJ&rsquo;s more flexible policy approach earlier this week, while the Rinban announcement also failed to spur price action as the BoJ kept purchases of 5yr-10yr JGBs inline with yesterday&rsquo;s unscheduled announcement.</p>\r\n",
