The buck was, however, weakening into the news, dropping overnight, as concerns about trade wars give rise to fears of a structurally weaker dollar. The immediate fortunes of the dollar will be determined whether Trump chooses to implement the steel/aluminium tariffs. There is now growing scepticism that he will refrain from doing so, given the opposition from some senior GOP. A possible out may be his meeting with US companies that use steel and aluminium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JPY: The risk-on bid helped USDJPY to rise towards the 106.50 level, though it held, and subsequently, the pair fell back towards the 106.20 neutral level, which traders have been watching. But some desks are avoiding complacency, noting that if Trump were to implement any tariffs, the yen would likely catch a bid on risk-aversion, as well as the narrative of a structurally weaker US dollar. The BOJ&rsquo;s bond buying operations will be looked to overnight, but the main focus is the BOJ meeting at the end of the week (unlikely to be any fireworks).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EUR: managed to rise to two-week highs against the USD. The single currency was largely unfazed by the Italian election uncertainty, and is looking to this week&rsquo;s ECB (may tweak guidance) as the next major EUR-driven catalyst (US tariffs could also dictate action from the USD-side). The EUR has had the ability to look-through politics as the economy recovers, and SPD members voting to join a grand coalition in Germany over the weekend mitigates some of the political risk in the currency. We had a look slightly above 1.24 on the improving risk tone, but remain around the figure heading into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD: pared back some of Monday&rsquo;s losses, and seem to be a beneficiary of the risk-on moves in early US trade, where oil and stocks also ticked higher; the Loonie slipped to beneath 1.29, backing away from fresh YTD highs ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BOC meeting, which is unlikely to reveal any new policy tilt on Wednesday (unchanged expected) though its comments on trade will be crucial in shaping the CAD&rsquo;s direction; analysts note that it was only when the central bank detailed its concerns regarding US protectionism in January that it became a crucial issue for Loonie traders. The pair has since come back beneath the figure ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BOC (expected unchanged).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AUD and NZD: high-yield FX was in vogue as traders moved into risk after news from the Korean peninsula, helping the Aussie to break above 0.78, and the Kiwi to above 0.73, with both currencies trading around those levels as we head into APAC trade. Overnight, Australian Q4 GDP data will be eyed, and although the data is likely to keep the RBA cautious, there has been some upside risks introduced by better than expected trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><a name=\"_Hlk507704203\">COMMODITIES</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (Mar 2) 5.661M vs. Exp. 2.700M (Prev. 0.933M).

Furthermore, North Korea is said to be willing to freeze nuclear and missile activities during discussions with the US. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump repeated he would like to go down a peaceful path but would be willing to go either way, while a senior administration official stated that the US stance to North Korea will not change unless it sees concrete moves for denuclearization. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kaplan (non-voter) said the Fed should start tightening policy soon and that he still sees a case for 3 rate hikes this year. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US President Trump reiterated that the US will go ahead with tariffs plan. However, there were also comments from Republican Senator Purdue that President Trump is open to changes on tariffs, while Senate Majority leader McConnell stated there is a lot of concern over tariffs and is also concerned it could turn in to a trade war. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Factory Orders MM (Jan) -1.4% vs. Exp. -1.3% (Prev. 1.7%, Rev. 1.8%)<br />US Durable Goods, R MM (Jan) -3.6% (Prev. -3.7%)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The better risk tone couldn&rsquo;t spur US equities meaningfully higher; perhaps equity traders are cognizant of the risks related to possible steel/aluminium tariffs; while steel names are likely to gain on the news, companies that use steel in production will see costs rise. Equities did get a small boost on multiple occasions, as headlines crossed hinting that Trump would reconsider the implementation of tariffs. Nevertheless, after making its way through 2720 again, action in the EMINI S&amp;P 500 was capped by 2730. SPX +0.26% at 2728, DJI +0.04% at 24,885, Nasdaq Comp +0.57% at 7,372.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were choppy around the neutral line in Tuesday trade, with yields trading +/- 1-2bps across the curve. Major curves flattened modestly. The TPLEX saw selling action in early trade as the risk tone improved following positive geopolitical developments from the Korean peninsula. US 10-Year T-Note settled half-a-tick higher at 120-21+.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "US MARKET WRAP: 6 MAR 2018: Geopolitics spur risk on, trade concerns linger",
        "content": "<ul><li><strong>Positive geopolitical developments from the Korean peninsula spur risk sentiment</strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>Trade wars narrative cools, with hints Trump adviser Cohn will leave if tariffs implemented </strong></li>\r\n  <li><strong>SNAPSHOT: Dollar lower, stocks flat, Treasuries flat, crude slightly higher ahead of API</strong></li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/18729/download\"><strong>DOWNLOAD FULL REPORT WITH DAY AHEAD RPEVIEW HERE</strong></a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>KEY THEMES:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GEOPOLITICS:</strong> North Korea said to be open to denuclearisation if regime safety is guaranteed, according to South Korean Envoy, cited by Yonhap. North Korea also was said to be willing to freeze nuclear and missile activities during discussions with the US. The news forced an immediate switch in risk tone, with the optimism helping stocks higher, and havens lower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRADE WARS:</strong> Concerns about trade wars eased on Monday after it emerged that senior GOP officials (House Speaker Ryan, White House Advisor Cohn) had urged Trump to refrain from implementing tariffs. And despite Trump continuing to talk tough on Tuesday, further reports revealed that the number of GOP lawmakers against tariffs was growing (Senate Majority Leader McConnell, for instance, talked about the concerns of a trade war, while Senator Cruz was also reportedly against it). These headlines did offer some support to equities. Other reports suggested that Advisor Cohn was being pushed towards the exit, although Fox News, citing sources, reported that he would remain at the White House even if tariffs were implemented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES: SPX +0.26% at 2728, DJI +0.04% at 24,885, Nasdaq Comp +0.57% at 7,372</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SECTORS: </strong>CONS DISC (XLY): +0.72%, CONS STAP (XLP): +0.09%, ENERGY (XLE): +0.04%, FINANCIALS (XLF): +0.40%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): -0.13%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): +0.49%, MATERIALS (XLB): +1.08%, TECH (XLK): +0.24%, TELECOMS (XTL): +0.44%, UTLITIES (XLU): -1.36%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>US EQUITIES</strong> the better risk tone couldn&rsquo;t spur US equities meaningfully higher; perhaps equity traders are cognizant of the risks related to possible steel/aluminium tariffs; while steel names are likely to gain on the news, companies that use steel in production will see costs rise. Equities did get a small boost on multiple occasions, as headlines crossed hinting that Trump would reconsider the implementation of tariffs. Nevertheless, after making its way through 2720 again, action in the EMINI S&amp;P 500 was capped by 2730. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CRUDE: WTI FUTURES SETTLE 3 CENTS HIGHER AT USD 62.60 PER BARREL; BRENT SETTLES 25 CENTS HIGHER AT USD 65.79 PER BARREL.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CRUDE</strong> bounced higher with risk sentiment in early US trade, after positive news from the Korean peninsula, while a softer dollar was also contributing. However, sellers emerged, and sold into crude strength (WTI topping out beneath $63.30, Brent topping-out beneath 66.20). Traders were citing the return of Libya&rsquo;s Sharara field (normal operations have returned), the attempted restart at Motiva&rsquo;s Port Arthur Refinery (600k BPD), as well as expectations for this week&rsquo;s energy inventory data, which analysts forecast will show a crude headline build of 2.7m, Cushing seen drawing by around 687k, distillate expected to draw 1.2m, and gasoline is also expected to draw by 1.2m.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>OPEC SURVEY:</strong> A Platts survey predicts that OPEC&rsquo;s Feb crude output would fall by 70k BPD vs Jan levels, to 32.39m BPD. <strong>OPEC JAWBONE:</strong> Following US shale producers&rsquo; dinner with OPEC sec gen Barkindo on Monday, reports emerged that there was nothing specific to come out of the meeting, and the dinner was all &ldquo;platitudes and generalisations.&rdquo; Elsewhere, UAE energy min today warned that there is still a long way to go to rebalance the crude market, and the OPEC cartel will have a plan to keep the market balanced when the OPEC+ supply cut deal expires next year, while Russia&rsquo;s dep energy minister sees the oil market rebalancing by in H2/Q3 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EIA STEO</strong> cut its forecast for world oil demand growth in 2018 by 30k BPD (to 1.7m Y/Y rise), while also forecasting that US production would rise by 1.38m BPD in 2018 (raising its forecast from 1.26m).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME:</strong> <strong>US 10-Year T-Note settled half-a-tick higher at 120-21+</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treasuries were choppy around the neutral line in Tuesday trade, with yields trading +/- 1-2bps across the curve. Major curves flattened modestly. The TPLEX saw selling action in early trade as the risk tone improved following positive geopolitical developments from the Korean peninsula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CVS</strong> (CVS) launched $40b nine-part US offering to finance its $69b acquisition of Aetna (AET). Books reached $120b, according to reports, and there were concerns in the US morning about how the supply would be digested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: USD WEAKER, COMMODITY FX FIRMER</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>USD</strong>: weakened on geopolitical reports from the Korean peninsula, as traders sought risk. The buck was, however, weakening into the news, dropping overnight, as concerns about trade wars give rise to fears of a structurally weaker dollar. The immediate fortunes of the dollar will be determined whether Trump chooses to implement the steel/aluminium tariffs. There is now growing scepticism that he will refrain from doing so, given the opposition from some senior GOP. A possible out may be his meeting with US companies that use steel and aluminium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>JPY:</strong> The risk-on bid helped USDJPY to rise towards the 106.50 level, though it held, and subsequently, the pair fell back towards the 106.20 neutral level, which traders have been watching. But some desks are avoiding complacency, noting that if Trump were to implement any tariffs, the yen would likely catch a bid on risk-aversion, as well as the narrative of a structurally weaker US dollar. The BOJ&rsquo;s bond buying operations will be looked to overnight, but the main focus is the BOJ meeting at the end of the week (unlikely to be any fireworks).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>EUR:</strong> managed to rise to two-week highs against the USD. The single currency was largely unfazed by the Italian election uncertainty, and is looking to this week&rsquo;s ECB (may tweak guidance) as the next major EUR-driven catalyst (US tariffs could also dictate action from the USD-side). The EUR has had the ability to look-through politics as the economy recovers, and SPD members voting to join a grand coalition in Germany over the weekend mitigates some of the political risk in the currency. We had a look slightly above 1.24 on the improving risk tone, but remain around the figure heading into APAC trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>CAD: </strong>pared back some of Monday&rsquo;s losses, and seem to be a beneficiary of the risk-on moves in early US trade, where oil and stocks also ticked higher; the Loonie slipped to beneath 1.29, backing away from fresh YTD highs ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BOC meeting, which is unlikely to reveal any new policy tilt on Wednesday (unchanged expected) though its comments on trade will be crucial in shaping the CAD&rsquo;s direction; analysts note that it was only when the central bank detailed its concerns regarding US protectionism in January that it became a crucial issue for Loonie traders. The pair has since come back beneath the figure ahead of tomorrow&rsquo;s BOC (expected unchanged).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* <strong>AUD</strong> and <strong>NZD</strong>: high-yield FX was in vogue as traders moved into risk after news from the Korean peninsula, helping the Aussie to break above 0.78, and the Kiwi to above 0.73, with both currencies trading around those levels as we head into APAC trade. Overnight, Australian Q4 GDP data will be eyed, and although the data is likely to keep the RBA cautious, there has been some upside risks introduced by better than expected trade data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ransquawk.com/research_sheets/18729/download\"><strong>DOWNLOAD FULL REPORT WITH DAY AHEAD RPEVIEW HERE</strong></a></p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>A turnaround Tuesday in many ways as risk appetite returned and picked up significantly after reports that North Korea is ready and willing to discuss nuclear disarmament under certain conditions. The so called &lsquo;safe-haven&rsquo; currencies lost more ground after an improvement in broad sentiment overnight, while the likes of the Nzd, Aud, Cad and Eur accelerated recovery gains vs the Usd to peaks above 0.7300, almost 0.7850, 1.2865 and 1.2400+ respectively from session lows around 0.7220, 0.7755, 1.2995 and 1.2330. Cable vaulted 1.3900, but lagged amidst ongoing Brexit uncertainty that kept Eur/Gbp north of 0.8900 despite some reports about Eur/cross flow on the bid side. Usd/Jpy retested offers, a major Fib and psychological resistance near 106.50, but recoiled again and slipped back to 106.00, with Usd/Chf easing back through 0.9400. As a result, the DXY lost hold of the 90.000 level, and almost reversed to test nearest strong technical support at 89.503 (February 26 low). Ahead, the Aud will be eyeing Q4 GDP data for some independent direction and hot on the heels of the still neutral/cautious RBA, while the Cad focus shifts to Wednesday&rsquo;s BoC policy meeting that is expected to culminate in unchanged rates and also an on hold stance due to all the ongoing NAFTA and import tariff uncertainty. More immediately, Sterling may derive some impetus from BoE&rsquo;s Haldane and/or any further comments on transition from the latest round of UK-EU meetings.</p>\r\n",

This positive momentum gathered pace across Asia-Pac bourses with <strong>ASX 200 (+1.1%)</strong> also underpinned by strength across the energy sector, and <strong>Nikkei 225 (+1.8%)</strong> outperformed as exporters cheered a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, <strong>Hang Seng (+2.1%)</strong> joined in on the elation, while the <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%)</strong> initially retreated amid a glum tone in the mainland after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations, but then later conformed to the region. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with demand sapped amid gains across riskier assets and a mixed 30yr auction result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC skipped open market operations. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC set USD/CNY mid-point at 6.3386 vs. Prev. 6.3431</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANKS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>RBA Interest Rate Decision (Mar) 1.50% vs. Exp. 1.50% (Prev. 1.50%).</strong> RBA reiterated that it judged holding policy rates was consistent with sustainable economic growth and reaching the inflation target, while it also repeated that a strengthening exchange rate could slow pace of economic activity and inflation. Furthermore, RBA also stated that low level of rates continues to support domestic economy and that the outlook is for faster growth this year than last year, while it added that wage growth is to remain subdued for some time and gradually pick up. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australian Current Account Balance (Q4) -14.00B vs. Exp. -12.30B (Prev. -9.10B, Rev. -11.0B).

However, Kuroda added that they will obviously debate on exit strategy once target is achieved and that the central bank is brainstorming how a future exit could impact the balance sheet. Later adding that he only said an exit strategy may be debated if inflation reaches 2% during 2019. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank Governor Ingves stated that weaker inflationary pressures creating uncertainty, adding that monetary policy needs to proceed cautiously. Furthermore, saying that inflation will be near 2% even though forecasts have been adjusted downwards. It&rsquo;s too early and too big a risk to raise rates now. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riksbank&rsquo;s Ohlsson said that inflation has remained close to the target and now is the time to begin normalising monetary policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>GEOPOLITCAL </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea is said to be open to denuclearisation if regime safety is guaranteed, according to the South Korean Envoy. North Korea added they are willing to freeze nuclear and missile activities during discussions with the US. (Yonhap)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EU/UK/US</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Trade Representative Lighthizer said that Canada and Mexico will get a tariff exclusion with a new NAFTA agreement which will be an incentive to conclude a deal.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EU is said to consider tariffs of US steel, denim and bourbon, according to sources. Total worth of imports subject to tariffs is EUR 2.8bln. Commission proposes a tariff of 25% on these products. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As trade war fears are easing, the European cash open mimicked the lead seen on Wall St. and overnight in Asia, with all major bourses now firmly in the green (Eurostoxx 50 +0.9%). FTSE MIB (1.4%) and DAX 30 (+1.1%) are clear outperformers today following the underperformance seen yesterday in both indices. Materials sector outperformance has been supported by firmer commodity prices. Smurfit Kappa (+18.9%), a noticeable mover today following news of the company rejecting an unsolicited offer from US based International Paper. Telecom Italia (+5.6%) are seen at the top of the FTSE MIB amid news Elliott Management have increased their stake in the company. Just Eat (-7.2%), a major laggard in focus today after the company failed to deliver on earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much net movement in <strong>Usd/majors</strong>, but an overall improvement in risk appetite has sapped some strength from the traditional safe-havens, with the <strong>Jpy</strong> also taking on board comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who clarified that easy policy will remain in place until such time that inflation reaches the 2% target level, which is currently forecast during fy 2019. <strong>Usd/Jpy</strong> back below 106.00 and <strong>Usd/Chf</strong> nearer the top of its 0.9385-0.9420 trading parameters with little reaction Swiss CPI data that was firmer than expected m/m, but bang in line with consensus in y/y terms. <strong>Usd/Cad</strong> remains firmer having just crossed over 1.3000 yesterday amidst ongoing NAFTA and US import tariff concerns, and with the options market indicating more <strong>Loonie</strong> depreciation ahead. The Kiwi is still benefiting from relative <strong>Aud </strong>weakness down under after some Aussie data misses overnight (Q4 current account and January retail sales vs a tad smaller decline in Q4 net exports) and a largely unchanged RBA on rates and in the accompanying statement (growth to pick up vs 2017, but inflation and wages still lagging). <strong>Nzd/Usd</strong> just over 0.7250 and <strong>Aud/Usd</strong> retreating from a brief 0.7800 test, as <strong>Aud/Nzd</strong> pulls back towards 1.0700. Elsewhere, some divergence in <strong>Eur/Scandi </strong>crosses, with the <strong>Nok</strong> up near 9.6250 highs on an upbeat Norwegian regional survey, but the <strong>Sek</strong> down to fresh 10.2000+ multi-year lows on more cautious Riksbank policy guidance from Governor Ingves and shrugging off reasons to start normalisation now from rate hike dissenter Ohlsson. Back to <strong>Usd/G10</strong> pairs, <strong>Eur/Usd</strong> looks more supported above 1.2300, but perhaps capped by its 30 DMA around 1.2363, and Cable is holding the bulk of Monday&rsquo;s gains over 1.3800 on UK PM May&rsquo;s claims that a transition deal is getting closer (and notwithstanding more reports of hard-line EU demands).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Somewhat belatedly, but in the aftermath of German and UK auctions <strong>Bunds</strong> and <strong>Gilts</strong> witnessed another bout of selling, this time starting on Eurex where stops were triggered on a break of near term support around the 159.40 area (that encompassed Monday&rsquo;s intraday low). The core bond is now just off a fresh 159.12 base (-76 ticks) and now eyeing the next downside chart level at 159.03. Gilts have fallen to 120.68 (-63 ticks), with support seen at 120.48 (February 27&rsquo;s Liffe session low). Risk back on flows come amidst very conciliatory talk attributed to North Korea. Elsewhere, previously resilient <strong>US</strong> <strong>Treasuries</strong> have not been able to escape the latest fallout in core EU bonds with futures now all underwater and the curve steeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WTI</strong> and <strong>Brent</strong> crude futures trade little changed but in close proximity to yesterday&rsquo;s highs after the IEA took an upbeat view on global oil demand and OPEC Sec-Gen continued to show support for the solidity of the global supply cut agreement. Further newsflow will likely emanate from the Houston energy conference. In metals markets, spot <strong>gold</strong> trades with modest gains alongside a slightly softer USD with the move in the yellow metal capped to the upside by this morning&rsquo;s risk appetite. Elsewhere, <strong>zinc</strong> prices saw their largest declines in three months in China following rising inventories whilst <strong>steel</strong> saw further selling pressure overnight as soft demand continues to hamper prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The core bond is now just off a fresh 159.12 base (-76 ticks) and now eyeing the next downside chart level at 159.03. Gilts have fallen to 120.68 (-63 ticks), with support seen at 120.48 (February 27&rsquo;s Liffe session low). Risk back on flows come amidst very conciliatory talk attributed to North Korea.</p>\r\n",

        "subject": "EU MID-SESSION UPDATE: European bourses firmer as trade war tensions ease (for now?). USD marginally softer, USD/JPY back below 106.00.",
        "content": "<p>As trade war fears are easing, the European cash open mimicked the lead seen on Wall St. and overnight in Asia, with all major bourses now firmly in the green (Eurostoxx 50 +0.9%). DAX 30 (+1.3%) and FTSE MIB (1.2%) are clear outperformers today following the underperformance seen yesterday in both indices. Materials sector outperformance has been supported by firmer commodity prices. Smurfit Kappa (+18.4%), a noticeable mover today following news of the company rejecting an unsolicited offer from US based International Paper. Telecom Italia (+5.1%) are seen at the top of the FTSE MIB amid news Elliott Management have increased their stake in the company. Just Eat (-10%), a major laggard in focus today after the company failed to deliver on earnings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK debt has seen a bit more downside in recent trade, and perhaps psychologically if not significantly, the 10 year benchmark has lost grip of 121.00 on its way down to a new intraday Liffe low at 120.92 (41 ticks below Monday&rsquo;s close). No specific fundamental reason for the further loss of traction, but the FTSE and other EU indices are consolidating gains and there could be some concession building for the looming long end auction. Elsewhere, Bunds also pulling away from their recovery peak (159.74) and closer to the early Eurex base, as BTPs continue to claw back Italian election-related declines. Technically, the core German bond needs to hold the 159.45 low, given rising channel support and yesterday&rsquo;s session trough are not far below at 159.40-41. US Treasuries remain firmer in contrast, albeit off overnight highs having made way for the rebound on Wall Street late on Monday and looking ahead to US data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not much net movement in Usd/majors, but an overall improvement in risk appetite has sapped some strength from the traditional safe-havens, with the Jpy also taking on board comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who clarified that easy policy will remain in place until such time that inflation reaches the 2% target level, which is currently forecast during fy 2019. Usd/Jpy back below 106.00 and Usd/Chf nearer the top of its 0.9385-0.9420 trading parameters with little reaction Swiss CPI data that was firmer than expected m/m, but bang in line with consensus in y/y terms. Usd/Cad remains firmer having just crossed over 1.3000 yesterday amidst ongoing NAFTA and US import tariff concerns, and with the options market indicating more Loonie depreciation ahead. The Kiwi is still benefiting from relative Aud weakness down under after some Aussie data misses overnight (Q4 current account and January retail sales vs a tad smaller decline in Q4 net exports) and a largely unchanged RBA on rates and in the accompanying statement (growth to pick up vs 2017, but inflation and wages still lagging). Nzd/Usd just under 0.7250 and Aud/Usd retreating from a brief 0.7800 test, as Aud/Nzd pulls back towards 1.0700. Elsewhere, some divergence in Eur/Scandi crosses, with the Nok up near 9.6250 highs on an upbeat Norwegian regional survey, but the Sek down to fresh 10.2000+ multi-year lows on more cautious Riksbank policy guidance from Governor Ingves and shrugging off reasons to start normalisation now from rate hike dissenter Ohlsson. Back to Usd/G10 pairs, Eur/Usd looks more supported above 1.2300, but perhaps capped by its 30 DMA around 1.2363, and Cable is holding the bulk of Monday&rsquo;s gains over 1.3800 on UK PM May&rsquo;s claims that a transition deal is getting closer (and notwithstanding more reports of hard-line EU demands).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent crude futures trade little changed but in close proximity to yesterday&rsquo;s highs after the IEA took an upbeat view on global oil demand and OPEC Sec-Gen continued to show support for the solidity of the global supply cut agreement. Further newsflow will likely emanate from the Houston energy conference. In metals markets, spot gold trades with modest gains alongside a slightly softer USD with the move in the yellow metal capped to the upside by this morning&rsquo;s risk appetite. Elsewhere, zinc prices saw their largest declines in three months in China following rising inventories whilst steel saw further selling pressure overnight as soft demand continues to hamper prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The 10y bond has cheapened c. 1bp on the roll into the auction, leaving it c. 2.4bp cheap and a little on the rich side versus previous rolls. Cross market, since 9 February, 10y Austria has underperformed Germany by 5bp, France by 2bp and Holland by 4bp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>German longer linker auctions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today Germany reopens the DBR&euro;i26 and DBR&euro;i30 for EUR 500mln each. This will be the first time that the Finanzagentur taps two linkers simultaneously. The real yield selloff since mid-December may help, but probably more relevant for today&rsquo;s auctions is that recent repo trading levels for both bonds suggests there is a short base in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UK auction: DMO opens the 30y Gilt</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The DMO returns to the market with the GBP 2.3bln tap of UKT 1.5% Jul 2047. In risk terms, the supply is equivalent to 48k Long Gilt Future contracts or GBP 4.9mln/bp. On an outright basis, 30y gilt yields peaked at 2.05% in mid-February to currently stand at just over 1.9%. Gilt 10/30s has flattened close to 20bp since the beginning of the year as the long end has proved to be resilient despite the selloff in the front end of the curve. This the final long conventional supply of the current issuance programme, with no long supply now until the announcement of the new financing remit next week and the supply timetable for the next quarter. It is likely that the market will need a concession to absorb the supply smoothly but demand for the long end has been robust so any concession may well be short lived.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Not much net movement in Usd/majors, but an overall improvement in risk appetite has sapped some strength from the traditional safe-havens, with the Jpy also taking on board comments from BoJ Governor Kuroda who clarified that easy policy will remain in place until such time that inflation reaches the 2% target level, which is currently forecast during fy 2019. Usd/Jpy back down towards the lower end of a 106.00-50 range (or 106.47 to be precise, just ahead of a key 106.48 Fib) and Usd/Chf nearer the top of its 0.9385-0.9420 trading parameters with little reaction Swiss CPI data that was firmer than expected m/m, but bang in line with consensus in y/y terms. Usd/Cad remains firmer having just crossed over 1.3000 yesterday amidst ongoing NAFTA and US import tariff concerns, and with the options market indicating more Loonie depreciation ahead. The Kiwi is still benefiting from relative Aud weakness down under after some Aussie data misses overnight (Q4 current account and January retail sales vs a tad smaller decline in Q4 net exports) and a largely unchanged RBA on rates and in the accompanying statement (growth to pick up vs 2017, but inflation and wages still lagging). Nzd/Usd just under 0.7250 and Aud/Usd retreating from a brief 0.7800 test, as Aud/Nzd pulls back towards 1.0700. Elsewhere, some divergence in Eur/Scandi crosses, with the Nok up near 9.6250 highs on an upbeat Norwegian regional survey, but the Sek down to fresh 10.2000+ multi-year lows on more cautious Riksbank policy guidance from Governor Ingves and shrugging off reasons to start normalisation now from rate hike dissenter Ohlsson. Back to Usd/G10 pairs, Eur/Usd looks more supported above 1.2300, but perhaps capped by its 30 DMA around 1.2363, and Cable is holding the bulk of Monday&rsquo;s gains over 1.3800 on UK PM May&rsquo;s claims that a transition deal is getting closer (and notwithstanding more reports of hard-line EU demands).</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks were mostly higher after sentiment rolled over from Wall St where all majors gained at least 1% after trade war fears somewhat abated and amid encouraging data releases. This positive momentum gathered pace across Asia-Pac bourses with ASX 200 (+1.1%) also underpinned by strength across the energy sector, and Nikkei 225 (+2.0%) outperformed as exporters cheered a weaker JPY. Elsewhere, Hang Seng (+1.7%) joined in on the elation, while the Shanghai Comp. (-0.8%) initially retreated amid a glum tone in the mainland after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations, but then later conformed to the region. Finally, 10yr JGBs were subdued with demand sapped amid gains across riskier assets and a mixed 30yr auction result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY weakened on safe-haven outflows amid the heightened global risk appetite which supported USD/JPY firmly above 106.00, although some gains were later pared after comments from Kuroda that the BoJ were brainstorming on the impact an exit would have on the BoJ&rsquo;s balance sheet. USD was also softer overnight in which the DXY slipped back below the 90.00 level to the benefit of EUR/USD, while GBP/USD was less decisive amid Brexit overhang. Elsewhere, AUD/USD gained on a weaker greenback but saw brief pressure following a miss on Current Account and Retail Sales data, while the RBA rate decision failed to spur any meaningful price action as it kept rates unchanged as unanimously expected and mostly stuck to reiterations in its statement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>The RBA are to decide on rates today in which the consensus remains one-sided for the central bank to maintain the Cash Rate Target at the record low 1.50%. This has been reflected in ASX 30-day Interbank Cash Rate Futures which price in 100% expectations for the RBA to remain on hold, while the respective implied yield curve suggests the central bank is likely to stay on pause throughout the entire year with February 2019 the earliest in which the curve is leaning more towards a 25bps hike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The case for the RBA to maintain policy settings has been supported by the ongoing backdrop of soft wage growth and below-target inflation in Australia, which has also spurred banks to revise their 2018 rate hike forecasts with ANZ Bank dropping calls for 2 hikes this year and now sees rates to be kept unchanged, while NAB has cut its forecasts to 1 hike late this year v Prev. estimate of 2 hikes. In addition, the most recent employment data and capex figures were somewhat inconclusive with Employment Change better than expected but which was solely due to Part-Time jobs, while Private Capex missed estimates although this was accompanied by upward revisions to the prior and the 2017-2018 estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elsewhere, the rhetoric from the RBA continues to suggest the bank is in no rush for policy changes as Governor Lowe stated that the most likely next move in rates is up but added that he doesn&#39;t see a strong case for near-term policy adjustment. Governor Lowe was also somewhat blas&eacute; on the currency as he commented that AUD is manageable on a trade weighted basis and that he would prefer a lower AUD than higher, but &#39;we are where we are&#39;. Furthermore, the minutes from the prior meeting and the RBA Quarterly Statement of Monetary Policy haven&#39;t provided any signals of a near-term change in the status quo as the central bank stuck to its usual rhetoric regarding the adverse effects of an appreciating AUD, while it also maintained its growth and inflation forecasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rate decision is scheduled for 0330GMT/2230EST/1130HKT, although the market reaction to the announcement is expected be light given that a hold in rates is widely seen to be a forgone conclusion. Meanwhile, focus will turn to the accompanying statement for any clues of future policy and the central bank&#39;s tone regarding the economy and inflation.</p>\r\n",

(-0.3%) underperforms amid a glum tone in the mainland after the PBoC refrained from liquidity operations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, JPY weakened across the board on safe-haven outflows amid the heightened global risk appetite with USD/JPY firmly above 106.00 and JPY-crosses extending on the prior day&rsquo;s highs. USD is also softer overnight in which the DXY slipped back below the 90.00 level to the benefit of EUR/USD, while GBP/USD is less decisive amid Brexit overhang.
