(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK government spokesperson Slack commented the UK will be leaving the customs union and the government also later stated it is planning a customs arrangement with the EU. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Irish PM Varadkar stated that Ireland must step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit outcome although he believes that this scenario is unlikely.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed Chair Powell reiterated gradual hikes and that it is difficult to predict how trade policy talks may influence the economy, while he also commented that overall risks are &#39;roughly balanced&#39;. Powell further stated the US is on target inflation over the next several years with appropriate monetary policy and that recent inflation readings are encouraging, while he noted the latest data suggests US growth was considerably stronger in Q2. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Agricultural Secretary Perdue said we are getting close to an agreement with Canada and Mexico, while there were also comments from Canadian PM Trudeau that they are going to be able to get a good NAFTA deal. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Industrial Production (Jun) M/M 0.6% vs. Exp. 0.6% (Prev. -0.1%, Rev. -0.5%). (Newswires)<br />US Manufacturing Production (Jun) M/M 0.8% vs. Exp. 0.7% (Prev. -0.7%, Rev. -1.0%)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After NFLX reported grim earnings aftermarket on Monday, as well as AMZN&rsquo;s tech issues on its &lsquo;Prime Day&rsquo;, US Equity futures were negative and sideways in the premarket. However, as the cash day got underway, the bias was to the upside, aided by strong earnings reports from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) &amp; Charles Schwab (SCHW). Newswires are also attributing the gains to Fed chair of Powell&rsquo;s semi-annual testimony, where he gave an upbeat assessment of the US economy. However, this was very much a reiteration and he generally avoided rocking the boat. The Emini S&amp;P hit its highest levels in five months, after it broke through the key 2800 level once again. Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs (GS) confirmed the appointment of David Solomon as CEO, and he will take role in October while current CEO Lloyd Blankfein will remain chairman until the end of the year. Goldman also reported numbers, which beat on both top- and bottom-lines, with Q2 FICC revenues higher by 45% Y/Y, though equity revenues were flat y/y. In afternoon trade, shares in US automakers (GM, F) moved higher on news that the EU was considering exploring talks with US President Trump on car-tariff reduction. SPX +0.40% at 2809, NDX +0.63% at 7403, DJI +0.23% at 25121.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Treasury complex settled lower on Tuesday in typically thin summer volumes, with the yield curve modestly bear-flattening, though yields were more-or&mdash;less unchanged. Some parts of the curve hit the flattest level in almost 11 years. Most of the action was concentrated in the front-end where the 2yr yield at its highest level in decade after Fed&rsquo;s Powell stroke a positive tone on the US economy and avoided comments on the flattening yield curve on Tuesday, while again making upbeat comments on the economy, endorsing gradual hikes. Money markets are now pricing in an 89% probability of a rate hike in September. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 1+ ticks lower at 120-04.</p>\r\n",

Japan and Europe on Tuesday signed the largest bilateral trade deal globally in an active move against protectionism on the back of trade tensions between US and China. The pact includes significant concessions from both sides, and is likely to lower Japanese tariffs on food products from Europe, whilst lifting EU tariffs on cars and parts coming from Japan. Note the deal is subject to approval by both European and Japanese lawmakers. Elsewhere, US Agricultural Secretary Perdue said we are getting close to an agreement with Canada and Mexico. The US has requested WTO talks over retaliatory tariffs on US goods. Domestically, there were continued signs that Republicans are pushing back on Trump, after Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Hatch said he might support a bill to curtail Trump&rsquo;s trade powers. Separately, ahead of Friday&rsquo;s G20 meeting, the draft summit communique reportedly mentions trade as a growth engine, and expresses support for multilateral trade rules &ndash; the communique was said to face no objection from the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* TRUMP: </strong>US President Trump conceded that Russia did meddle in the 2016 US Presidential election. On geopolitical matters, Trump said he hopes that Iran will eventually call the US and possibly make a new deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FED:</strong> Chairman Powell didn&rsquo;t rock the boat (once again) in the text of his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee. Powell reiterated the FOMC&rsquo;s view for gradual rate hikes, noting that overall risks to the US economy appear &lsquo;roughly balanced&rsquo;. On trade, the Fed chair talked about the difficulties in predicting how trade policy talks might influence the US economy, but said trade uncertainty could be a threat to wage growth. Generally, Powell continued to express optimism on the US economy, stating that the labour market can continue to strengthen over the next &lsquo;several years&rsquo;, as can inflation. Powell also noted that the run of data shows Q2 growth was considerably stronger, and recent inflation metrics were encouraging. However, some picked-up on signs of caution in Powell&rsquo;s comments, Scotiabank points out: Powell said &ldquo;with a strong job market, inflation close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the FOMC believes that&mdash;for now&mdash;the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate.&rdquo; And Scotia says the rest of that same &lsquo;for now&rsquo; paragraph gives the risks of going too fast versus too slow and openness to changing forecasts if needed but not yet, also citing Powell&rsquo;s line that &quot;as always, our actions will depend on the economic outlook, which may change as we receive new data.&quot; Scotiabank writes &ldquo;None of this is necessarily surprising given data dependency, but &ldquo;for now&rdquo; and &quot;may change&quot; could be taken as indicating somewhat less confidence in their forecasts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* ECB: </strong>ECB&rsquo;s Rehn said it was wise that monetary policy not tie ones hand if there is no need, adding that markets seem to be reading the ECB&rsquo;s forward guidance correctly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* BREXIT: </strong>The government defeated an attempted rebellion by pro-EU lawmakers, who attached an amendment in the Trade Bill to compel the UK government to adopt membership of the EU customs union should they fail to push through the deal envisaged by May by January 2019. The win for the government is said to give UK PM May more strength to negotiate her position with the EU. On the news, GBP saw two way action in choppy trade; on the one hand, giving the government more scope to pursue a not-so-soft-Brexit was considered a negative for the UK currency, however, a stable government lent some strength to the pound; the net/net result was GBP was little changed since before the vote took place, though did see some very choppy price action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION:</strong> IP was up 0.6% in July M/M, in line with expectations, and also saw a jump from the revised -0.1% in June. Mining and utilities were both robust though the gains were only partially offset by a surprising decline in utilities. 75% of the rise in manufacturing was attributed to production resuming in the auto sector after a fire disrupted activity at a truck parts in May, analysts at Oxford Economics noted, the &ldquo;industrial sector momentum looks favourable at the moment,&rdquo; though OxEco did warn that &ldquo;the road ahead looks a bit precarious&rdquo; as even if higher oil prices and the tax cuts are positive for the industrial sector, a stronger greenback, supply constraints and most importantly trade war uncertainty may weigh on industrial output in the near future. OxEco estimates that the tariffs announced so far could trim 0.4ppts from real GDP growth in the coming year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* WTI (Q8) SETTLES 2 CENTS HIGHER AT $68.08/BBL; WTI (U8) SETTLES 9 CENTS HIGHER $67.07/BBL; BRENT (U8) SETTLES 32 CENTS HIGHER AT $72.16/BBL</strong>. Term structures were moving bearishly in early trade, and at one point in the session, both WTI and Brent front month contracts were in contango (note: the WTI Q8 contract expires on Friday), with concerns of higher output continuing to linger. With that said, there has been some stabilisation in prices following yesterday&rsquo;s slide, perhaps in part due to the labour strikes in Norway and the geopolitics around Iran, where output is likely to fall as the US reimposes sanctions (note: it was reported that the US has rejected all French, German and British demands on Iran sanctions exemptions). Analysts at PVM said the competing supply-side forces has underpinned widespread uncertainty, which will ensure volatile trading conditions; analysts at Goldman Sachs are also expect crude to trade volatile in the months ahead, and see Brent within a range of $70-$80 per barrel this year. Ultimately, as equities caught a bid in afternoon trade and sentiment became more constructive, crude erased losses for the day. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* CRUDE OUTPUT: </strong>Libya&#39;s oil production at Waha is up to 70k-80k BPD from 20k BPD, according to sources; other reports suggested that Libyan output has risen to 650-700k BPD amid port re-openings, sources said (Agoco output was up to 220k BPD, newswires reported on Tuesday, vs the 150-180k BPD on 16 July). However, later in the session, Libya&rsquo;s state-NOC declared a force majeure on loadings at the Zawiya oil terminal, and the NOC also said output at Sharara had fallen to 125k BPD (from 130k BPD on Monday). Meanwhile, Russian oil output was up by 273k BPD in July to 11.22mln BPD, and output at Iraq&#39;s southern oil exports is knocking around 3.566mln BPD in July so far (it was averaging 3.521mln BPD in June). The kicker is that output and exports in Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq were higher in the first half of July, and Angola will raise September crude exports to 1.51mln BPD. Amid these developments, chatter of a release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve continue to do the rounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* INVENTORY EXPECTATIONS:</strong> Analysts expect US crude stocks to draw down by 3.6mln in the week, gasoline stocks are seen unchanged, and distillates are forecast to build by 900k. Stocks at the Cushing hub are seen lower by 368k (from 10/Jul) and lower by 1.3mln (from 6/Jul). API reports its weekly inventory data aftermarket on Tuesday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* SPX +0.40% at 2809, NDX +0.63% at 7403, DJI +0.23% at 25121. </strong>SECTORS: Cons Cyclicals: +0.79%, Cons Non-Cyclicals: +0.10%, Energy: -0.38%, Financials: +0.16%, Health Care: +0.54%, Industrials: +0.38%, Materials: +1.32%, Telecoms: -0.36%, Tech: +0.81%, Utilities: -0.06%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* FUTURES: </strong>After NFLX reported grim earnings aftermarket on Monday, as well as AMZN&rsquo;s tech issues on its &lsquo;Prime Day&rsquo;,&nbsp; US equity US Equity futures were negative and sideways in the premarket. However, as the cash day got underway, the bias was to the upside, aided by strong earnings reports from Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) &amp; Charles Schwab (SCHW). Newswires are also attributing the gains to Fed chair of Powell&rsquo;s semi-annual testimony, where he gave an upbeat assessment of the US economy. However, this was very much a reiteration and he generally avoided rocking the boat. The Emini S&amp;P hit its highest levels in five months, after it broke through the key 2800 level once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* STOCK SPECIFICS: </strong>Netflix&rsquo;s (NFLX) was hit in Monday&rsquo;s AMC trade after reporting light subscriber additions in Q2, though has pared back those losses in Tuesday trade (it was down 14% at one point). Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) earnings beat expectations, however, it cut FY sales guidance, which caused a wobble in the pre-market, though JNJ opened higher and steadily built on gains. Goldman Sachs (GS) confirmed the appointment of David Solomon as CEO, and he will take role in October while current CEO Lloyd Blankfein will remain chairman until the end of the year. Goldman also reported numbers, which beat on both top- and bottom-lines, with Q2 FICC revenues higher by 45% Y/Y, though equity revenues were flat y/y. In afternoon trade, shares in US automakers (GM, F) moved higher on news that the EU was considering exploring talks with US President Trump on car-tariff reduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* US 10YR T-NOTES FUTURES (U8) SETTLE 1+ TICKS LOWER AT 120-04. </strong>The Treasury complex settled lower on Tuesday in typically thin summer volumes, with the yield curve modestly bear-flattening, though yields were more-or&mdash;less unchanged. Some parts of the curve hit the flattest level in almost 11 years. Most of the action was concentrated in the front-end where the 2yr yield at its highest level in decade after Fed&rsquo;s Powell stroke a positive tone on the US economy and avoided comments on the flattening yield curve on Tuesday, while again making upbeat comments on the economy, endorsing gradual hikes. Money markets are now pricing in an 89% probability of a rate hike in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* USD: </strong>Dollar strength was attributed to upbeat comments by Fed chair Jerome Powell, who successfully avoided rocking the boat too much in the first part of his semi-annual testimony to congress. However, the initial reaction of the dollar to Powell&rsquo;s remarks was negative, before the greenback found a bid, and then went on to print HOD above the 95 handle (95.062). US industrial production data also added to the allure of the buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* GBP: </strong>On the news that the UK government defeated an attempted rebellion by pro-EU lawmakers, GBP saw two way action in choppy trade; on the one hand, giving the government more scope to pursue a not-so-soft-Brexit was considered a negative for the UK currency, however, a stable government lent some strength to the pound; the net/net result was GBP was little changed since before the vote took place, though did see some very choppy price action. After the dust had settled, the bias for sterling was to the upside marginally, with the pound coming off lows seen in the day against the EUR and GBP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* NZD: </strong>New Zealand Dairy Prices were 1.7% lower (Prev. -5.0%) to $3,222. Whole Milk Powder prices rose by 1.5% to $2,973. There was little reaction in the NZD.</p>\r\n",

With that said, there has been some stabilisation in prices following yesterday&rsquo;s slide, perhaps in part due to the labour strikes in Norway and the geopolitics around Iran, where output is likely to fall as the US reimposes sanctions (note: it was reported that the US has rejected all French, German and British demands on Iran sanctions exemptions). Analysts at PVM said the competing supply-side forces has underpinned widespread uncertainty, which will ensure volatile trading conditions; analysts at Goldman Sachs are also expect crude to trade volatile in the months ahead, and see Brent within a range of $70-$80 per barrel this year. Ultimately, as equities caught a bid in afternoon trade and sentiment became more constructive, crude erased losses for the day.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>CRUDE OUTPUT: </strong>Libya&#39;s oil production at Waha is up to 70k-80k BPD from 20k BPD, according to sources; other reports suggested that Libyan output has risen to 650-700k BPD amid port re-openings, sources said (Agoco output was up to 220k BPD, newswires reported on Tuesday, vs the 150-180k BPD on 16 July). However, later in the session, Libya&rsquo;s state-NOC declared a force majeure on loadings at the Zawiya oil terminal, and the NOC also said output at Sharara had fallen to 125k BPD (from 130k BPD on Monday). Meanwhile, Russian oil output was up by 273k BPD in July to 11.22mln BPD, and output at Iraq&#39;s southern oil exports is knocking around 3.566mln BPD in July so far (it was averaging 3.521mln BPD in June). The kicker is that output and exports in Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq were higher in the first half of July, and Angola will raise September crude exports to 1.51mln BPD. Amid these developments, chatter of a release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve continue to do the rounds.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>INVENTORY EXPECTATIONS: </strong>Analysts expect US crude stocks to draw down by 3.6mln in the week, gasoline stocks are seen unchanged, and distillates are forecast to build by 900k. Stocks at the Cushing hub are seen lower by 368k (from 10/Jul) and lower by 1.3mln (from 6/Jul). API reports its weekly inventory data aftermarket on Tuesday.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "subject": "PRIMER: Fed Chair Powell Dual-Testimony to the US Senate (Tues, July 17) and the US House (Weds, July 18)",
        "content": "<ul><li>Fed&rsquo;s Jerome Powell &ndash; who since his appointment as chair, has generally tended to avoid rocking the boat in his public addresses &ndash; will be testifying in his capacity as Fed chair, so will likely repeat the themes from the June FOMC meeting minutes; Powell will likely give a nod to the Fed&rsquo;s current economic and rate projections, which look for two more rate rises in 2018, as the Fed normalises policy gradually.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>TRADE WARS: </strong>The subject of trade will feature heavily, not only because of the economic implications, but also the political nature of the subject (and the Testimonies). The FOMC&rsquo;s June meeting minutes showed that the Fed is cognizant about global trade risks, noting that these risks had intensified and were concerning; the central bank&rsquo;s contacts have also expressed concerns about how tariffs might impact investment, the minutes showed, with some contacts also suggesting that capital spending has already been scaled back. In an interview last week, Powell continued on the theme, sounding a note of caution with regards to the state of global trade, stating that there is a rising level of concern about the effects of changes in trade policy, any trade disputes or high tariffs will be a negative for the economy.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>WAGES:</strong> In his interview last week, Powell was upbeat about the state of the economy, with unemployment rate low and inflation near target. Regarding wages, Powell said that while the labour market is strong by any measure, low wage growth remained a puzzle.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>FISCAL STIMULUS: </strong>There was another note of caution with regards to inflation/fiscal stimulus, warning that it would be challenging for the Fed to raise rates while the economy was weakening. Powell believes the fiscal stimulus will support the economy over the next three years.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>YIELD CURVE: </strong>His comments on the shape of the yield curve will be of note, given that the gap between 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields narrowed to a fresh low around 25bps last week; the recent FOMC meeting saw staff present theories on the yield curve, apparently concerned that any inversion could be a signal of a recession.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) was negative with the index dragged by losses in energy names following a decline of around 4% in oil due to concerns a supply glut could return and as miners suffered from early weakness in Shanghai metal prices. Conversely, Nikkei 225 (+0.4%) bucked the trend on return from the extended weekend amid JPY weakness, while Shanghai Comp. (-0.6%) and Hang Seng (-1.3%) led the declines despite continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC, amid overhang from trade uncertainties and with energy names pressured. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices subdued amid a positive tone in Tokyo stocks but with downside also restricted amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market concentrated in the short end and belly of the curve.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />NDRC said China faces large difficulties in achieving stable development during H2 amid shocks from trade tensions but added that China has ample of space to deal with shocks. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day and CNY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 90bln. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />PBoC set CNY mid-point at 6.6821 (Prev. 6.6758)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Chinese House Prices (Jun) Y/Y 5.0% (Prev. 4.7%). (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>BREXIT&nbsp;</strong><br />The UK government narrowly curbed a defeat on the Custom Bill after compromising with Brexiteers demands. The House of Commons approved (voting 305 to 302) the clause to prevent the UK collecting taxes on behalf of another territory or country, unless this were done on a reciprocal basis.&nbsp;<br />Subsequently, Conservative Eurosceptics have declared that they have killed off UK PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan by making her adopt changes that will leave it &lsquo;dead on arrival&rsquo; in Brussels. (Telegraph) Remain-supporting MPs are said to be furious with May caving to the demands of the Eurosceptics. (Times)&nbsp;<br />UK Defence Procurement Minister and Remain advocate Guto Bebb resigned after the government accepted ERG amendments. (Newswires)&nbsp;<br />EU/UK/US&nbsp;<br />UK Average Earnings (Ex-Bonus) May 2.7% vs. Exp. 2.7% (Prev. 2.8%) (Newswires) UK Average Earnings (+Bonus) May 2.5% vs. Exp. 2.5% (Prev. 2.5%, Rev. 2.6%) UK ILO Unemployment Rate May 4.2% vs. Exp. 4.2% (Prev. 4.2%) UK Claimant Count Unemployment Change Jun 7.8k vs. Exp. -2.1k (Prev. -7.7k, Rev. -3.0k)&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EQUITIES&nbsp;</strong><br />European equities trade mostly negative (Eurostoxx 50 -0.5%, DAX -0.2%) in what has been a relatively light session thus far in terms of newsflow. European markets have opted to shrug off the broadly softer Asia-Pac lead which saw sentiment hampered by yesterday&rsquo;s declines in energy prices and slump in Nasdaq futures after Netflix subscriber growth figures fell short of street estimates.&nbsp;<br />In terms of sectors, telecom names lag their peers after Orange (-1.4%) were cut to neutral from buy at Citi and Telenor (-1.8%) earnings fell short of market expectations. Material names are seen higher despite ongoing trade concerns as gains in Thyssenkrupp (+8.3%) lift the sector amid news that their Chairman is to leave the Co., following the recent resignation of their CEO.&nbsp;<br />Other individual movers include Casino (+3.8%) who are higher following encouraging sales figures which has also pulled Carrefour (+1.5%) higher in sympathy. Royal Mail&rsquo;s (+2.0%) latest trading update has been welcomed by the market, whilst Tom Tom (+4.7%) shares have headed north after upping their revenue and EPS guidance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very well received if not strong German 2 year auction has helped core bonds regroup after the earlier downturn that continued in wake of the UK labour report on certain encouraging metrics, like the low unemployment rate. Bunds have rebounded to a marginal new intraday peak at 162.80 and Gilts towards their previous session high of 123.26, while Schatz futures are mid-range and 7 ticks above their previous close. US Treasuries a bit more mixed, but only marginally either side of parity with the curve fractionally steeper ahead of IP data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX&nbsp;</strong><br />NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is now head and shoulders above the G10 pack on elevated NZ inflation data, but not the headline measures that were actually a tad softer than expected. Instead, it was the RBNZ&rsquo;s preferred core or factor model measure that hit a 1.7% y/y 7 year peak that boosted the Nzd to 0.6840 vs the Usd and not far from 1.0860 vs the Aud, which lagged in wake of neutral RBA minutes flagging heightened global trade risks due to hyped up import tariff threats between the US and China amongst others. Aud/Usd remains above 0.7400 on a broadly soft Greenback, but is still wary about option expiries at the strike through this week, with 800 mn falling today.&nbsp;<br />CHF/EUR - Both benefiting from the ongoing Dollar retracement off recent peaks (DXY circa 94.300 and drifting further vs 95.243 last week), with the Franc pivoting 0.9950 and single currency consolidating above 1.1700, but capped ahead of 1.1750 after testing resistance around 1.1740 (top of a cloud base).&nbsp;<br />GBP - Resilient in wake of another Government semi U-turn on post-Brexit proposals, with Cable rotating around 1.3250 and Eur/Gbp circling 0.8850 following UK labour data showing underlying strength in the jobs market, albeit with wages still not reflecting high levels of employment perhaps.&nbsp;<br />CAD/JPY - Relatively flat vs the Usd with the Loonie just off highs in a 1.3110-40 range ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales data, while Usd/Jpy meanders between 112.25-55 with heavy offers layered above 112.50 and markets looking towards US ip data for some further direction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES&nbsp;</strong><br />WTI and Brent (+0.1% and +0.3% respectively) crude futures trade in close proximity to recent lows as market forces continue to act against the commodity. Prices have been unable to make any meaningful recovery from recent losses which have stemmed from ongoing concerns that a supply glut could return amid reports the US is open to considering waivers on Iran sanctions, Libyan refineries coming back online, as well as recent chatter that the US was mulling dipping into the strategic petroleum reserve. In terms of energy newsflow from today&rsquo;s session, Libyan sources report that domestic oil output has risen to 650-700k bpd as ports continue to re-open. With this in mind, Goldman Sachs state that they still expect Brent crude to retest USD 80/bbl although it may occur in late 2018 rather than previous forecast of summer, citing US stance on oil.&nbsp;<br />In metals markets, spot gold (+0.36%) has seen some modest support from the broadly softer USD with traders mindful of today&rsquo;s congressional testimony from Fed Chair Powell. Elsewhere, copper is seen higher by around 1% in London trade as LME inventories remain tight, whilst steel prices were seen lower overnight as recent Chinese data poses some concern for the market. Finally, Indian government sources suggest that the nation is still in talks with the US regarding the rolling back of steel tariffs with India ready to impose safeguards if necessary.&nbsp;<br />Iran&#39;s Foreign Minister Zarif says steps are being taken for the continued sale of oil.

European markets have opted to shrug off the broadly softer Asia-Pac lead which saw sentiment hampered by yesterday&rsquo;s declines in energy prices and slump in Nasdaq futures after Netflix subscriber growth figures fell short of street estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of sectors, telecom names lag their peers after Orange (-1.4%) were cut to neutral from buy at Citi and Telenor (-1.8%) earnings fell short of market expectations. Material names are seen higher despite ongoing trade concerns as gains in Thyssenkrupp (+7.0%) lift the sector amid news that their Chairman is to leave the Co., following the recent resignation of their CEO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other individual movers include Casino (+3.9%) who are higher following encouraging sales figures which has also pulled Carrefour (+1.5%) higher in sympathy. Royal Mail&rsquo;s (+2.8%) latest trading update has been welcomed by the market, whilst Tom Tom (+3.9%) shares have headed north after upping their revenue and EPS guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>NZD/AUD - The Kiwi is now head and shoulders above the G10 pack on elevated NZ inflation data, but not the headline measures that were actually a tad softer than expected. Instead, it was the RBNZ&rsquo;s preferred core or factor model measure that hit a 1.7% y/y 7 year peak that boosted the Nzd to 0.6840 vs the Usd and not far from 1.0860 vs the Aud, which lagged in wake of neutral RBA minutes flagging heightened global trade risks due to hyped up import tariff threats between the US and China amongst others. Aud/Usd remains above 0.7400 on a broadly soft Greenback, but is still wary about option expiries at the strike through this week, with 800 mn falling today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHF/EUR - Both benefiting from the ongoing Dollar retracement off recent peaks (DXY circa 94.300 and drifting further vs 95.243 last week), with the Franc pivoting 0.9950 and single currency consolidating above 1.1700, but capped ahead of 1.1750 after testing resistance around 1.1740 (top of a cloud base).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>GBP - Resilient in wake of another Government semi U-turn on post-Brexit proposals, with Cable rotating around 1.3250 and Eur/Gbp circling 0.8850 following UK labour data showing underlying strength in the jobs market, albeit with wages still not reflecting high levels of employment perhaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CAD/JPY - Relatively flat vs the Usd with the Loonie just off highs in a 1.3110-40 range ahead of Canadian manufacturing sales data, while Usd/Jpy meanders between 112.25-55 with heavy offers layered above 112.50 and markets looking towards US ip data for some further direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very well received if not strong German 2 year auction has helped core bonds regroup after the earlier downturn that continued in wake of the UK labour report on certain encouraging metrics, like the low unemployment rate. Bunds have rebounded to 162.69 and Gilts towards 123.20 from the low 123.00 area, while Schatz futures are mid-range and 7 ticks above their previous close. US Treasuries a bit more mixed, but only marginally either side of parity with the curve fractionally steeper ahead of IP data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI and Brent (+0.1% and +0.3% respectively) crude futures trade in close proximity to recent lows as market forces continue to act against the commodity. Prices have been unable to make any meaningful recovery from recent losses which have stemmed from ongoing concerns that a supply glut could return amid reports the US is open to considering waivers on Iran sanctions, Libyan refineries coming back online, as well as recent chatter that the US was mulling dipping into the strategic petroleum reserve. In terms of energy newsflow from today&rsquo;s session, Libyan sources report that domestic oil output has risen to 650-700k bpd as ports continue to re-open. With this in mind, Goldman Sachs state that they still expect Brent crude to retest USD 80/bbl although it may occur in late 2018 rather than previous forecast of summer, citing US stance on oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In metals markets, spot gold (+0.36%) has seen some modest support from the broadly softer USD with traders mindful of today&rsquo;s congressional testimony from Fed Chair Powell. Elsewhere, copper is seen higher by around 1% in London trade as LME inventories remain tight, whilst steel prices were seen lower overnight as recent Chinese data poses some concern for the market. Finally, Indian government sources suggest that the nation is still in talks with the US regarding the rolling back of steel tariffs with India ready to impose safeguards if necessary.</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.5%) was negative with the index dragged by losses in energy names following a decline of around 4% in oil due to concerns a supply glut could return and as miners suffered from early weakness in Shanghai metal prices. Conversely, Nikkei 225 (+0.9%) bucked the trend on return from the extended weekend amid JPY weakness, while Shanghai Comp. (-1.0%) and Hang Seng (-1.0%) led the declines despite continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC, amid overhang from trade uncertainties and with energy names pressured. Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices subdued amid a positive tone in Tokyo stocks but with downside also restricted amid the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market concentrated in the short end and belly of the curve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NDRC said China faces large difficulties in achieving stable development during H2 amid shocks from trade tensions but added that China has ample of space to deal with shocks. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PBoC injected CNY 70bln via 7-day and CNY 30bln via 14-day reverse repos for a net daily injection of CNY 90bln.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK/EU</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notable Cross Border Tax Bill Amendment Votes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />- UK House of Commons voted (316 to 289) against New Clause 11 of the Cross-Border Tax Bill which would have made establishing tariff free access to the EU as a negotiating objective for the UK Government.<br />- House of Commons voted (305 to 302) to approve New Clause 36 which prevents the UK collecting taxes on behalf of another territory or country, unless this were done on a reciprocal basis.<br />- House of Commons voted (303 to 300) to approve Amendment 73 which commits the Government to having a separate VAT system to the EU.<br />- House of Commons voted 318 to 285 to approve the third reading of the Cross-Border Tax Bill which progresses the bill to the House of Lords. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- House of Commons voted (316 to 36) against New Clause 16 which would have required approval from Scottish Parliament to implement some of the powers in the Bill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, Conservative Eurospectics have declared that they have killed off UK PM May&rsquo;s Chequers plan by making her adopt changes that will leave it &lsquo;dead on arrival&rsquo; in Brussels. (Telegraph) Remain-supporting MPs are said to be furious with May caving to the demands of the Eurosecptics. (Times)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UK Defence Procurement Minister and Remain advocate Guto Bebb resigned after the government accepted ERG amendments. (Newswires)<br />&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In FX markets, the DXY was lacklustre overnight but consolidated around the 94.50 level, while EUR/USD saw mild gains after support held at 1.1700 and GBP/USD attempted to nurse some of yesterday&rsquo;s Brexit-related declines which were triggered by the UK government&rsquo;s acceptance of amendments proposed by hard-line Eurosceptic MPs. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses were slightly higher on the return of Japanese participants, while AUD/USD was initially choppy after the RBA minutes stuck to reiterations before it later coat-tailed on NZD outperformance after the RBNZ&rsquo;s preferred inflation gauge rose to its highest in 7 years which overshadowed the earlier softer than expected CPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RBA minutes from July 3rd meeting stated the board judged it was appropriate to maintain policy and that the next rate move is likely to be a hike if the economy improves as expected but added it saw no strong case for a near-term change. The minutes also noted that AUD had declined slightly but remains in range of the past 2 years and that recent data consistent with view for GDP to increase a bit more than 3% in 2018 and 2019.

Elsewhere, gold prices traded flat amid consolidation in the greenback and with participants awaiting Fed Chair Powell&rsquo;s testimony later, while copper was higher on a continuation of yesterday&rsquo;s rebound to eye the USD 2.90/lb level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Senator Grassley introduced a bill against OPEC &#39;price fixing&#39; and stated that OPEC output quotas keep prices artificially high. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Goldman Sachs said it still expects Brent crude to retest USD 80/bbl although it may occur in late 2018 rather than previous forecast of summer, in which it cited US policies on oil. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were higher across the curve in thin volume, with the curve modestly bear-steepening at settlement, which was 2s10s rise by just shy of 1bps, but still within the 25bps handle. Short-dated yields rose to highs not seen in almost a decade ahead of Tuesday&rsquo;s testimony by Fed chair Powell (See below for preview). There was little by way of major moves in Treasuries after retail sales data, however, losses appeared to be scaling back in afternoon trade as equities, and more noticeably, oil found selling action. US 10YR T-notes futures (U8) settled 6 ticks lower at 120-05+.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fed&#39;s Kashkari (non-voter, dove) said policymakers are focused on the flattening of the yield curve and that he is unsure whether the flattening yield curve signals a recession ahead. Furthermore, Kashkari stated that Fed is risking inverting the yield curve by continuing to hike and that there is little reason to raise rates further since doing so could trigger a recession. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mexico said it will take defensive actions and respond to US trade measures. (Newswires)</p>\r\n",

ASX 200 (-0.6%) is negative with the index dragged by losses in energy names following a decline of around 4% in oil due to concerns a supply glut could return and with miners suffering from early declines in Shanghai metal prices. Conversely, Nikkei 225 (+0.5%) bucks the trend on return from the extended weekend amid JPY weakness while Shanghai Comp. (-0.9%) and Hang Seng (-0.9%) are negative, despite continued liquidity efforts by the PBoC, as energy names are pressured and amid overhang from trade uncertainties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets remain quiet with the DXY consolidating around the 95.50 level, while EUR/USD is steady amid support at 1.1700 and GBP/USD languishes after yesterday&rsquo;s Brexit-related declines in which the UK government accepted amendments proposed by Eurosceptic MPs. Elsewhere, USD/JPY and JPY-crosses are slightly higher on return of Japanese participants and antipodeans are indecisive with AUD choppy after the RBA minutes stuck to reiterations, while NZD briefly wobbled following softer than expected CPI data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs were uneventful with prices flat amid a positive tone in Tokyo stocks and the BoJ&rsquo;s presence in the market concentrated in the short end and belly of the curve.</p>\r\n",

Furthermore, RBA repeated that inflation is likely to remain subdued for some time and that it expects a gradual pick-up in inflation with CPI expected to be a bit higher than 2% this year, while the RBA also commented that AUD has declined a little and that GDP growth is to average slightly above 3.0% this year and next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a guide, markets were unreactive to the actual policy announcement and statement considering the decision was as unanimously expected and with the RBA mostly sticking to reiterations in its statement.</p>\r\n",
