EUR is consolidating around 1.24, having found the air thin near 1.25; a dovish dose of ECB chatter and a fall in the EC&rsquo;s sentiment gauges kept the EUR offered, while some traders also cited bearish technicals. JPY couldn&rsquo;t meaningfully test 106.00 and made its way back down to below 105.50 as havens were bid (though CHF was mixed). GBP continued to take its cue from the USD, consolidating around 1.4150, though the range was wide (approx. 1.4070-1.4240). Risk FX (CAD, AUD, NZD) were lower on a stronger buck; for AUD, the 0.77 was breached again which tech folks say opens the way to Fib support around 0.7650; similarly, the USDCAD rose as risk sentiment softened, briefly breaching 1.29 to the upside. EMFX was weaker, taking its lead from the USD.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />COMMODITIES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US API weekly crude stocks (23 Mar) 5.321M vs. Exp. -0.300M (Prev. -2.739M).

Furthermore, Bostic said the Fed could soon face rising chances that the economy grows faster than forecast and leads to a slightly faster pace of rate rises. (WSJ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US Commerce Secretary Ross said markets are starting to realise that tariffs are a bargaining chip. (Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>US is to protect its tech sector through emergency law to curb China&#39;s takeovers, according to sources.

(Newswires)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />MARKET RECAP</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity futures suffered from a risk-off tone on Tuesday as markets await tariff details from the US, while traders are also keeping an eye out for details of Chinese counter-measures. As a result, defensive stocks outperformed with utilities leading, while the SPX and some sectors, such as consumer cyclicals and financials, weighed. Tech was the notable underperformer, closing over 4% lower, led by Nvidia (NVDA) halting its autonomous car tests, and Facebook (FB) due to ongoing privacy investigations. Also, its competitor Twitter (TWTR) slipped after Citron Research turned negative on the stock. Elsewhere, some auto names were firmer after UBS turned positive on the sector. In late trade the 2600 support level held the E-mini, with stocks seeing a small bounce heading into the close. SPX -1.73% at 2613, NDX -3.2% at 6530, DJI -1.43% at 23856.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yields were lower by between 4-6bps across the curve on Tuesday, as risk-off sentiment spurred a Treasury bid. As was the case on Monday, much of the action was focussed in the belly, where yields on 10s breached 2.80% falling to six-week lows. There was flattening in 2s5s, 2s10s, 2s30s by between 5-6bps, though 5s30s widened modestly at settlement. The US Treasury sold $35bln 5-year notes, tailing by 0.3bps &ndash; the fifth straight tail at a 5s auction. Cover was slightly higher than recent averages, while higher indirect participation was encouraging. Some remain impressed that the auction performed as it did given the bumper supply this week (slightly short of $300bln including bills). US 10-year T-note futures (m18) settled 14 ticks higher at 120-29.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p><strong>* SNAPSHOT: </strong>USD up, Treasuries up, Stocks down, oil down<br /><strong>* REAR-VIEW:&nbsp;</strong>Risk-off amid thin news/data docket, generally dovish ECB speak.<br /><strong>* AHEAD:&nbsp;</strong>China tariff details, API inventories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>* EQUITIES:&nbsp;SPX -1.73% at 2613 , NDX -3.2% at 6530 , DJI -1.43% at 23856</strong><br />* SECTORS: CONS CYC (XLY): -2.13%, CONS NON-CYC (XLP): -0.41%, ENERGY (XLE): -1.25%, FINANCIALS (XLF): -2.09%, HEALTH CARE (XLV): -1.48%, INDUSTRIALS (XLI): -1.78%, MATERIALS (XLB): -1.25%, TECH (XLK): -4.13%, TELECOMS (XTL): +0.29%, UTLITIES (XLU): +1.41%.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equity futures suffered from a risk-off tone on Tuesday as markets await tariff details from the US, while traders are also keeping an eye out for details of Chinese counter-measures. As a result, defensive stocks outperformed with utilities leading, while the SPX and some sectors, such as consumer cyclicals and financials, weighed. Tech was the notable underperformer, closing over 4% lower, led by Nvidia (NVDA) halting its autonomous car tests, and Facebook (FB) due to ongoing privacy investigations. Also, its competitor Twitter (TWTR) slipped after Citron Research turned negative on the stock. Elsewhere, some auto names were firmer after UBS turned positive on the sector. In late trade the 2600 support level held the E-mini, with stocks seeing a small bounce heading into the close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TREASURIES:&nbsp;US 10-YEAR T-NOTE FUTURES (M18) SETTLED 14 TICKS HIGHER AT 120-29.&nbsp;</strong>Yields were lower by between 4-6bps across the curve on Tuesday, as risk-off sentiment spurred a Treasury bid. As was the case on Monday, much of the action was focussed in the belly, where yields on 10s breached 2.80% falling to six-week lows. There was flattening in 2s5s, 2s10s, 2s30s by between 5-6bps, though 5s30s widened modestly at settlement. The US Treasury sold $35bln 5-year notes, tailing by 0.3bps &ndash; the fifth straight tail at a 5s auction. Cover was slightly higher than recent averages, while higher indirect participation was encouraging. Some remain impressed that the auction performed as it did given the bumper supply this week (slightly short of $300bln including bills).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FOREX: DXY +0.4% HEADING INTO APAC.&nbsp;</strong>There was little by way of first-tier releases or speakers on the slate, leaving the&nbsp;<strong>USD</strong>&nbsp;to trade-off broader sentiment. On Tuesday, the buck reiterated its credentials as a risk-off currency, strengthening as equities, crude and yields slid.&nbsp;<strong>EUR</strong>&nbsp;is consolidating around 1.24, having found the air thin near 1.25; a dovish dose of ECB chatter and a fall in the EC&rsquo;s sentiment gauges kept the EUR offered, while some traders also cited bearish technicals.&nbsp;<strong>JPY </strong>couldn&rsquo;t meaningfully test 106.00, and made its way back down to c.105.50 as havens were bid (though&nbsp;<strong>CHF</strong>&nbsp;was mixed).&nbsp;<strong>GBP</strong>&nbsp;continued to take its cue from the USD, consolidating around 1.4150, though the range was wide (approx. 1.4070-1.4240). Risk FX (CAD, AUD, NZD) were lower on a stronger buck; for&nbsp;<strong>AUD</strong>, the 0.77 was breached again which tech folks say opens the way to Fib support around 0.7650; similarly, the USDCAD rose as risk sentiment softened, briefly breaching 1.29 to the upside. EMFX was weaker, taking its lead from the USD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES:&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;WTI crude futures settle 30c lower at USD 65.25; Brent crude futures settle lower by 1c at USD 70.11</strong>.<br />Trading largely flat ahead of API&rsquo;s weekly inventory data, released after market close. The Street is expecting a headline crude draw 0.3mln. Genscape was said to forecast a 2.2mln build at Cushing. Meanwhile, analysts expect products to drawdown in the week, with distillate stocks seen declining by 1.6mln, and gasoline seen drawing by 2mln. Iraq&rsquo;s SOMO again talked-up compliance with OPEC&rsquo;s future decisions, adding that the country&rsquo;s oil output will not exceed 3.426mln bpd in March. Also on the jawboning front, Saudi Arabia stated that the OPEC/Non-OPEC agreement is not a year-by-year project. It added that OPEC was seeking a 10-20 year supply cooperation with Russia and other partner countries, and a broad agreement has been reached around this, though details still need to be worked out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>CENTRAL BANK SPEAK:&nbsp;</strong>The tone of&nbsp;<strong>ECB</strong>&nbsp;speak on Tuesday was mostly dovish. Focus seemed to be on ECB&rsquo;s Liikanen, normally a centrist, said EZ inflation would be considered sustainable when ECB&rsquo;s objective can be met without very accommodative policy. Similarly, Makuch followed saying underlying inflation trends show no convincing signs of an upturn. Some of the more hawkish members of the ECB also spoke; Vasiliasskus said he expects more detailed talks on policy changes in June, and agreed with the market pricing for a mid-2019 hike. ECB&rsquo;s Novotny also took a hawkish tone, and said he believes asset purchases should be removed gradually, adding if things continue they will be able to reduce asset purchases significantly and that they must decide by summer.&nbsp;<strong>Fedspeak&nbsp;</strong>was slightly easier on Tuesday, with the only notable comments from Bostic (voter), who said he wants to see gradual rate hikes, but noted that uncertainty over how the economy would respond next year to tax cuts and increased government spending could complicate monetary policy. Elsewhere, Bostic said the Fed could soon face rising chances that the economy grows faster than forecast and leads to a slightly faster pace of rate rises.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<ul><li><strong>THIS WEEK&rsquo;S SUPPLY: </strong>Ex-bills, the US Treasury will sell USD 109bln this week in 2-year (USD 30bln, Monday), 5-year notes (USD 35bln, Tuesday), 7-year (USD 29bln, Wednesday), as well as a 2-year FRN (USD 15bln, Wednesday). With USD 66.3bln maturing at end-month settlement, net supply is implied at USD 42.7bln, according to TD Securities.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>2-YEAR AUCTION REVIEW:</strong> Monday&rsquo;s auction of 2-year notes saw a tail of 0.4bps, though cover was slightly stronger than the prior. Perhaps the most interesting story was that it was digested well considering the Treasury + Bills issuance this week is set to come in just shy of $300bln.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>5-YEAR AUCTION PREVIEW:</strong> Last month&rsquo;s 5s auction came in on the screws, though the yield was highest since December 2009; cover, however, was softer than recent averages. In the latest week, dealers trimmed their holdings in the 3-6 year sector by $2.2bln, to $8.2bln. SocGen says that the current 5-year note trades cheap on asset swap compared to older 5s. The bank also suggests that there is no clear set-up going into the auction, and therefore, concession will likely be needed for the issuance to be underwritten smoothly. Elsewhere, the bank cites the size of issuance as a potential headwind, while also noting that 5-year notes haven&rsquo;t performed particularly well at auction, as of late.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br /><strong>RECENT AUCTION HISTORY (Via TD Securities)</strong><br /><img alt=\"\" height=\"334\" src=\"/system/ckeditor_assets/pictures/25/content_5s_history.JPG\" width=\"800\" /></p>\r\n",

Current very low levels of unemployment and strong growth momentum would normally be associated with other risks - in particular tighter monetary policy, a flatter yield curve and rising core inflation. But these remain subdued and without these risks rising, the prospect of a recession and &lsquo;cyclical&rsquo; bear market is low.</li>\r\n  <li>Structural bear market risks are also modest given the absence of major financial imbalances - or at least the shifting of imbalances away from the private sector to the public sector and central banks.</li>\r\n  <li>Slower growth and higher rates prospects point to lower risk adjusted returns this year but not a sustained bear market.</li>\r\n  <li>Valuation is a contributor to the index and is becoming less of a risk. The correction has resulted in a 5.7% de-rating in global equities YTD. The forward consensus PE for the MSCI AC World is back to its 1990 average and below its average ex Tech.</li>\r\n  <li>Elevated valuations are evident across most asset classes. Equities remain attractively valued relative to bonds (Equity risk premia are still elevated). n High equity valuations are mainly a feature of the US equity market and much of this can be explained by sector exposure and relative ROE.</li>\r\n  <li>Valuations also need to reflect the impact of share buybacks. The total cash return (the dividend yield plus the buyback yield) has increased in most markets despite collapsing bond yields post the financial crisis.</li>\r\n  <li>Free cash flow yields have also increased alongside higher P/E ratios.

        "subject": "JPMorgan says buy equities, valuations are below historical average",
        "content": "<ul><li>S&amp;P 500 is still down ~5% (vs. two weeks ago) and is trading at pre-tax reform levels despite stronger fundamentals (higher organic growth and margin expansion) and favorable flows (corporates are accelerating buyback programs and investors have significantly de-risked). Most of the selling seen over this period has been largely technical (trend-following strategies and option hedging in illiquid market environment), and as such represents a buying opportunity for fundamental investors. Based on consensus EPS estimate for next twelve months, S&amp;P 500 now trades at only ~16x (ex-cash ~15x), which is below 30-year median, see Figure 1. In addition to being cheap in absolute terms (below historical median), valuation looks even cheaper if taken in context of low global interest rates. For instance, over the past 30 years interest rates have averaged almost five times higher than current average global level of ~0.6%, see Figure 2. While the market appears to be overreacting to sequential negative narratives (e.g., inflation scare, rising yields, hawkish Fed, rising deficits), JP Morgan believe strong macro and fundamentals will continue to prevail. In the latest episode, the market&rsquo;s irrational response to tariffs on potentially $50b of Chinese imports led to investors erasing ~$4 trillion in global market capitalization (~100x total value of goods affected by tariffs). In fact, JP Morgan believe the impact of tariffs will be smaller than indicated by initial ask from the administration (see here) and it could lead to some positives such as greater liberalization of markets, agreements on IP rules, etc. remain constructive on equities and reiterate our S&amp;P 500 price target of 3,000.JP Morgan are also taking the market sell-off to upgrade Technology to Neutral on more favorable technicals, continued strong organic growth, lower USD, rising shareholder payouts, and cheaper valuation.</li>\r\n  <li>Fundamentals strong with >30% EPS growth over next two years. Since November, S&amp;P 500 consensus 2017-2019 earnings growth has been revised up sharply to 32% (vs. 22%) on back of much lower effective tax rate of 22% (vs. 27%) and stronger sales growth, see Figure 3. In our view, there is still room for estimates to move higher given indirect benefits of tax reform are difficult to model (i.e., the impact of dynamic scoring, rising disposable income, higher business investment). Also, they expect a record year for buybacks and believe consensus ~$500b estimate (vs. $527b in 2017) is underestimating the payout and potential EPS benefit. Based on our estimate, gross buybacks could total ~$800b in 2018 due to repatriation, lower tax policy uncertainty, and record earnings (organic growth and tax benefit expected to drive more than 30% EPS growth during 2017-19).</li>\r\n  <li>Upgrading Technology to Neutral. The sector should continue to deliver strong double-digit earnings growth on secular trends (e.g., cloud, ML), strong US and global demand (business investment in technology), weaker USD, and more favorable technicals. S&amp;P 500 Technology is expected to deliver superior growth while trades at market valuation. Also, the sector in aggregate holds ~$765 billion in overseas cash (or 15% of market cap), which they believe will be increasingly used for shareholder payouts (especially during market sell-offs) and could support a case for multiple re-rating, see Figure 6. In fact, S&amp;P the sector has already announced $73b in buybacks YTD (or ~45% of total S&amp;P 500 buyback announcements, see Figure 5) and are likely to announce additional programs during 1Q earnings season. However JP Morgan are Neutral on Tech given more favorable policy for domestic companies (e.g., lower taxes, deregulation, and potential infrastructure spending).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

The sharp recovery was spurred by easing trade war concerns after reports of US and China negotiating on trade and saw the largest percentage increase in all US majors since August 2015, while DJIA also gained by the most points in nearly a decade. <strong>ASX 200 (+0.7%)</strong> and <strong>Nikkei 225 (+2.7%)</strong> were higher in which mining names and financials led Australia, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed as the index coat-tailed on gains in USD/JPY and following the testimony by former tax office chief Sagawa who declared there were no instructions made by PM Abe or his close circle to alter the documents related to the land sale scandal. <strong>Hang Seng (+0.8%)</strong> and <strong>Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%)</strong> conformed to the upbeat tone as trade war concerns eased and as corporate financial results took centre stage in China, with the big 4 banks underpinned after AgBank beat estimates as it kicked off the earnings releases amongst China&rsquo;s banking behemoths. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker amid the gains in riskier assets and with demand also shunned following a mixed 40yr auction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan former tax agency chief Sagawa said there was no report to the PM&#39;s office of documents being altered and added that there were no instructions from PM Abe, his wife, Finance Minister Aso or their aides to doctor the documents. In related news, there were also comments from Finance Minister Aso that PM Abe&rsquo;s office was not involved with document alterations in the controversial land sale.

Looking at individual movers, Casino (+3.4%) spiked at the open after its Monoprix chain has agreed to sell products on Amazon, GSK (+6.0%) is a top performer in the FTSE 100 after it announced to purchase a 36.5% stake in Novartis&rsquo; healthcare unit for USD 13bln. Elsewhere, Akzo Nobel (+3.0%) received a boost after Carlyle has won the bid to acquire the chemical arm unit for approx. EUR 10bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FX</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very choppy trade in the currency markets with month end flows/positioning in evidence, but far from one-way or clear cut. The&nbsp;<strong>Eur</strong>&nbsp;outperformed during early trade and was a broad gainer vs G10 counterparts with the marginal exception of the&nbsp;<strong>Chf</strong>&nbsp;as that cross traded sideways within a confined 1.1760-75 range.&nbsp;<strong>Eur/Usd</strong>&nbsp;extended gains beyond near term resistance around 1.2446 to circa 1.2475, while&nbsp;<strong>Eur/Gbp</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Eur/Jpy</strong>&nbsp;got close to 0.8800 and 132.00 respectively on stops and buy orders that appeared to be fix-related. However, dovish ECB comments coincided with a loss of impetus and retreat in the single currency to the benefit of the Greenback and other peers, with a French bank noting &#39;strong&#39; Dollar demand for month end re-balancing (according to Newswires, Credit Agricole). Indeed, the DXY managed to reclaim 89.000+ status, as Cable recoiled to the 1.4125 area from 1.4240 highs,&nbsp;<strong>Aud/Usd</strong>&nbsp;pulled back from 0.7750+ to 0.7715 and&nbsp;<strong>Nzd/Usd</strong>&nbsp;topped out around 0.7300 again.&nbsp;<strong>Usd/Cad</strong>&nbsp;bounced ahead of strong chart support at 1.2803 and the psychological 1.2800 level as the&nbsp;<strong>Loonie</strong>&nbsp;lost some of its NAFTA related positive momentum (after US reports that a &lsquo;good&rsquo; deal is in the offing), while the&nbsp;<strong>Jpy</strong>&nbsp;continues to track overall risk sentiment and suffered on a sharp global stock market recovery &ndash; falling to 105.75 vs the&nbsp;<strong>Usd</strong>&nbsp;and testing resistance in the 105.70-75 zone (200 HMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>FIXED INCOME</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technical and fundamental factors could be attributed to the recovery in core bonds, as interim downside chart supports/targets held, while ECB speakers have been mainly dovish, especially Liikanen that reiterated a possible QE extension beyond September if necessary. However, the turnaround seemed to start on Liffe with <strong>Gilts</strong> that have tested the water above 122.00 at 122.03 (+21 ticks vs -9 ticks at worst) and there are big month end extensions to justify the underlying bid, while <strong>Bunds</strong> have been up to 159.09 (+16 ticks vs -20 ticks at the low). <strong>US Treasuries</strong> still lagging after the big Wall St revival yesterday and ahead of more hefty supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>COMMODITIES </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>WTI</strong> crude futures are flat after failing to breach the USD 66/bbl level to the upside ahead of this week&rsquo;s inventory releases and with Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister reiterating it is too early to discuss an exit from the output cut deal. Elsewhere, spot <strong>gold</strong> is trading marginally lower as it tracks fluctuations in the dollar index, while fears of trade wars recede after yesterday&rsquo;s reports of talks between US and China. In base metals, <strong>copper</strong> strengthened overnight amid the recovery in risk appetite and with upside spurred on the open of Chinese metals trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>European equities have joined the global relief rally (Eurostoxx +1.4%) seen between US and Asia overnight as trade tensions ease. In terms of sector specifics, materials (+1.4%) are the outperformers, enjoying a strong rebound from yesterday&rsquo;s losses. Looking at individual movers, Casino (+4.0%) spiked at the open after its Monoprix chain has agreed to sell products on Amazon, GSK (+4.7%) is a top performer in the FTSE 100 after it announced to purchase a 36.5% stake in Novartis&rsquo; healthcare unit for USD 13bln. Elsewhere, Akzo Nobel (+3.8%) received a boost after Carlyle has won the bid to acquire the chemical arm unit for approx. EUR 10bln.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite at least one bank model suggesting &lsquo;strong&rsquo; Dollar demand for month end rebalancing, the Eur outperformed during the early part of Tuesday&rsquo;s EU session and was a broad gainer vs G10 counterparts with the marginal exception of the Chf as that cross traded sideways within a confined 1.1760-75 range. Eur/Usd extended gains beyond near term resistance around 1.2446 to circa 1.2475, while Eur/Gbp and Eur/Jpy got close to 0.8800 and 132.00 respectively on stops and buy orders that appeared to be fix-related. However, dovish ECB comments coincided with a loss of impetus and retreat in the single currency to the benefit of the Greenback and other peers. Indeed, the DXY managed to reclaim 89.000+ status, albeit just, as Cable recoiled to the 1.4155 area from 1.4240 highs, Aud/Usd pulled back from 0.7750+ to 0.7720 and Nzd/Usd topped out around 0.7300 again. Usd/Cad bounced ahead of strong chart support at 1.2803 and the psychological 1.2800 level as the Loonie lost some of its NAFTA related positive momentum (after US reports that a &lsquo;good&rsquo; deal is in the offing), while the Jpy continues to track overall risk sentiment and suffered on a sharp global stock market recovery &ndash; falling to 105.75 vs the Usd and testing resistance in the 105.70-75 zone (200 HMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technical and fundamental factors could be attributed to the recovery in core bonds, as interim downside chart supports/targets held, while ECB speakers have been mainly dovish, especially Liikanen that reiterated a possible QE extension beyond September if necessary. However, the turnaround seemed to start on Liffe with Gilts that have tested the water above 122.00 at 122.03 (+21 ticks vs -9 ticks at worst) and there are big month end extensions to justify the underlying bid, while Bunds have been up to 159.09 (+16 ticks vs -20 ticks at the low). US Treasuries still lagging after the big Wall St revival yesterday and ahead of more hefty supply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>WTI crude futures are flat after failing to breach the USD 66/bbl level to the upside ahead of this week&rsquo;s inventory releases and with Russia&rsquo;s Energy Minister reiterating it is too early to discuss an exit from the output cut deal. Elsewhere, spot gold is trading flat as it tracks fluctuations in the dollar index, while fears of trade wars recede after yesterday&rsquo;s reports of talks between US and China. In base metals, copper strengthened overnight amid the recovery in risk appetite and with upside spurred on the open of Chinese metals trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

But the overall tone remained firm, as Trade War tensions ease following the US and China&rsquo;s decision to begin negotiating trade, which led to a risk-on market tone. There were also some positive comments from trade advisor Navarro, who sounded constructive on NAFTA and trade negotiations. All sectors closed the day in the green being led by the technology sector, following Morgan Stanley raising its price target on Microsoft (MSFT) to a street high, and Intel (INTC) being upgraded at Raymond James. However, focus was firmly on Facebook (FB) after the FTC announced an open, non-public investigation on the company&rsquo;s privacy practices. Since then, a Wells Fargo analyst came out with a note saying that the shares are now a buying opportunity with a price target of USD 230, which helped pare back today&rsquo;s losses as they close positive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks were positive across the board as the region took impetus from the gains on Wall St where stocks rebounded with a vengeance from the prior week&rsquo;s worst performance in 2 years. The sharp recovery was spurred by easing trade war concerns after reports of US and China negotiating on trade and saw the largest percentage increase in all US majors since August 2015, while DJIA also gained by the most points in nearly a decade. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+2.4%) were higher in which mining names and financials led Australia, while the Japanese benchmark outperformed as the index coat-tailed on gains in USD/JPY and following the testimony by former tax office chief Sagawa who declared there were no instructions made by PM Abe or his close circle to alter the documents related to the land sale scandal. Hang Seng (+0.9%) and Shanghai Comp. (+1.0%) conformed to the upbeat tone as trade war concerns eased and as corporate financial results took centre stage in China, with the big 4 banks underpinned after AgBank beat estimates as it kicked off the earnings releases amongst China&rsquo;s banking behemoths. Finally, 10yr JGBs were weaker amid the gains in riskier assets and with demand also shunned following a mixed 40yr auction.</p>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>Asia stocks are positive across the board as region takes impetus from the gains on Wall St where stocks rebounded with a vengeance from the prior week&rsquo;s worst performance in 2 years. The sharp recovery was spurred by easing trade war concerns after reports of US and China negotiating on trade and saw the largest percentage increase in all US majors since August 2015, while DJIA also gained by the most points in nearly a decade. ASX 200 (+0.7%) and Nikkei 225 (+1.7%) are higher with mining names and financials leading Australia, while Nikkei 225 outperforms as the index coat-tailed on gains in USD/JPY and following a testimony by former tax office chief Sagawa who declared there were no instructions made by PM Abe or his close circle to alter the documents related to the land sale scandal. Hang Seng (+0.7%) and Shanghai Comp. (+0.9%) conform to the upbeat tone as trade war concerns slightly ease and as corporate financial results take centre stage in China, with the big 4 banks underpinned after Agbank beat estimates as it kicked off the earnings releases amongst China&rsquo;s banking behemoths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FX markets continue to lack any major catalysts overnight amid light data releases, which in turn has kept risk sentiment as the main driving force. As such, safe-havens remain weaker with JPY taking the brunt of the rebound in stocks which has helped USD/JPY and JPY-crosses extend on gains, with further support seen after Sagawa&rsquo;s parliamentary testimony denied PM Abe involvement in the document alterations. Elsewhere, the DXY-index is off its worse levels although still lacks any meaningful recovery from yesterday&rsquo;s outflows which saw a breakdown attempt of the 89.00 level, while its major counterparts are relatively flat with EUR/USD and GBP/USD holding onto the recently reclaimed 1.2400 and 1.4200 handles respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, 10yr JGBs are weaker amid the gains in riskier assets and with demand shunned ahead of a 40yr auction later.</p>\r\n",
